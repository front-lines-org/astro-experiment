## History
![Al-Qurayshi compound pre-op](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Redirect/file/Al-Qurayshi_compound_pre-op.jpg?)
The Olive Tree Camp is a refugee camp that emerged during the Syrian Civil War. According to Bianet. about 80'000 people shall life in tents in the camp. Since October 201, internally displaced Syrians who failed to cross over to Turkey started settling between the olive trees. A new wave of refugees was triggered by the Syrian offensive in 2019.

A 150-year-old oak tree in Atme was cut down by members of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in November 2013. They accused the locals of venerating the tree instead of God. The town is under the control of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham. ISIL leader Abu Ibrahim al-Qurashi killed himself during a raid by US special forces on a house in Atme on February 3, 2022. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, thirteen other people, including seven civilians, died during the raid, which was noted by the media for its intensity.

Many of the local residents were "shocked" about the presence of Quraishi in the town, including Quraishi's landlord, who was unaware that his tenant was the leader of ISIL.
