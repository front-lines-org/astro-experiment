title: 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria
shortDescription: Turkish military offensive in northern Syria
description: The 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria, code-named
  Operation Peace Spring (Barış Pınarı Harekâtı) by Turkey, was a cross-border
  military operation conducted by the Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) and the Syrian
  National Army (SNA) against the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and later
  Syrian Arab Army (SAA) in northern Syria. On 6 October 2019, the Trump
  administration ordered American troops to withdraw from northeastern Syria,
  where the United States had been supporting its Kurdish allies. The military
  operation began on 9 October 2019 when the Turkish Air Force launched
  airstrikes on border towns.

The 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern [Syria](./Syria), code-named **Operation Peace Spring** (Barış Pınarı Harekâtı) by [Turkey](./Turkey), was a [cross-border](./Syria–Turkey_border) military operation conducted by the [Turkish Armed Forces](./Turkish_Armed_Forces) (TSK) and the [Syrian National Army](./Syrian_National_Army) (SNA) against the [Syrian Democratic Forces](./Syrian_Democratic_Forces) (SDF) and later [Syrian Arab Army](./Syrian_Arab_Army) (SAA) in northern Syria.

On 6 October 2019, the [Trump administration](./Trump_administration) ordered American troops to withdraw from northeastern Syria, where the United States [had been supporting](./American-led_intervention_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War) its Kurdish allies. The military operation began on 9 October 2019 when the [Turkish Air Force](./Turkish_Air_Force) launched airstrikes on [border](./Syria–Turkey_border) towns. The conflict resulted in the displacement of over 300,000 people and has caused the death of more than 70 civilians in Syria and 20 civilians in Turkey. Human rights violations have also been reported. [Amnesty International](./Amnesty_International) stated that it had gathered evidence of [war crimes](./war_crimes) and other violations committed by Turkey and Turkish-backed Syrian forces who are said to "have displayed a shameful disregard for civilian life, carrying out serious violations and war crimes, including summary killings and unlawful attacks that have killed and injured civilians".

According to Turkish President [Recep Tayyip Erdoğan](./Recep_Tayyip_Erdoğan), the operation was intended to expel the SDF—designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey "due to its ties with the [Kurdistan Workers Party](./Kurdistan_Workers_Party) (PKK)", but considered an ally against [ISIL](./ISIL) by the [Combined Joint Task Force – Operation Inherent Resolve](./Combined_Joint_Task_Force_–_Operation_Inherent_Resolve)—from the border region as well as to create a 30 km-deep (20 mi) "safe zone" in Northern Syria where some of the 3.6 million [Syrian refugees in Turkey](./Syrian_refugees_in_Turkey) would resettle. As the proposed settlement zone is heavily Kurdish demographically, this intention has been criticized as an attempt at [ethnic cleansing](./ethnic_cleansing),    a criticism rejected by the Turkish government who claimed they intended to "correct" the demographics that it alleges have been changed by the SDF.

The Turkish operation was met with mixed responses from the [international community](./international_community), including condemnations as well as support for the operation for the settlement of refugees in Northern Syria. Although Turkey claimed self-defense, according to international law experts it is an [illegal use of force](./act_of_aggression). While originally acknowledging Turkey's "right to defend itself", on 15 October, Russia hardened its position against the operation and deployed troops. Ten European nations and Canada [imposed an arms embargo on Turkey](./Reactions_to_the_2019_Turkish_offensive_into_north-eastern_Syria), while the U.S. imposed sanctions on Turkish ministries and senior government officials in response to the offensive in Syria. Likewise, Trump's sudden pullout of US forces in Syria was also criticized by many, including former US military personnel, as a "serious betrayal to the Kurds" as well as a "catastrophic blow to US credibility as an ally and Washington's standing on the world stage", with one journalist stating that "this is one of the worst US foreign policy disasters since the [Iraq War](./Iraq_War)". On 19 November, the [US Defense Department](./US_Defense_Department) inspector general released a report finding that the American withdrawal and subsequent Turkish incursion allowed ISIL to "reconstitute capabilities and resources within Syria and strengthen its ability to plan attacks abroad".

The [Syrian government](./Syrian_government) initially criticized the SDF for the Turkish offensive, accusing it of [separatism](./separatism) and not reconciling with the government, while at the same time also condemning the foreign invasion of Syrian territory. However, a few days later, the SDF reached an agreement with the Syrian government, in which it would allow the [Syrian Army](./Syrian_Army) to enter the SDF-held towns of [Manbij](./Manbij) and [Kobanî](./Kobanî) in an attempt to defend the towns from the Turkish offensive. Shortly thereafter, Syrian state broadcaster [SANA](./SANA) announced that Syrian Army troops had started to deploy to the country's north. Turkey and the SNA launched an offensive to capture Manbij on the same day.

On 17 October 2019, U.S. Vice President [Mike Pence](./Mike_Pence) announced that the U.S. and Turkey agreed on a deal in which Turkey would agree to a five-day ceasefire in Syria in return for a complete withdrawal by the SDF from its positions on the Syria-Turkey border. On 22 October 2019, Russian President [Vladimir Putin](./Vladimir_Putin) and Turkish President [Recep Tayyip Erdoğan](./Recep_Tayyip_Erdoğan) [reached a deal](./Second_Northern_Syria_Buffer_Zone) to extend the ceasefire by 150 additional hours if the SDF would move 30 kilometers away from the border, as well as from [Tal Rifaat](./Tal_Rifaat) and [Manbij](./Manbij). The terms of the deal also included joint Russian–Turkish patrols 10 kilometers into Syria from the border, except in the city of [Qamishli](./Qamishli). The new ceasefire started at 12pm local time on 23 October. The captured area remains part of the [Turkish occupation of northern Syria](./Turkish_occupation_of_northern_Syria).

Turkey has complained about a supposed presence of [PKK](./PKK)-related forces at its southern border since 2012, when the first [YPG](./YPG) pockets appeared during the [Syrian Civil War](./Syrian_Civil_War). Following the 2014 [Siege of Kobanî](./Siege_of_Kobanî) and the expansion of YPG/SDF forces and administration, Erdoğan's government considered the force a national security threat. The [2013–2015 peace process](./Solution_process) collapsed in July 2015, resulting in a war between PKK and Turkish forces. Like other regions in southeast Turkey, regions north of the border with Syria have seen numerous PKK-related deaths. According to a [Crisis Group](./Crisis_Group) death toll analysis based upon Turkey government and Turkish media publications, the border regions north of SDF-controlled areas had 8 Turkey security forces and 5 civilians killed in PKK-related violence in 2018 and 2019 prior to the offensive. The [Şırnak](./Şırnak) region had 26 security forces and 6 civilian deaths over the same period. Crisis Group did not specify if "PKK-related" deaths are linked to Syria's YPG and SDF, or from Turkey or Iraqi PKK.

Recent increase in jobless rate and electoral collaboration of opposition parties lead to significant AKP defeats in the [2019 Istanbul mayoral election](./2019_Istanbul_mayoral_election_(disambiguation)), signaling difficulties for the leadership party. Military operations are known to boost nationalism and Turkey executive's popularity. It is also seen as an effective way to break apart opposition alliances, between pro-Kurdish and pro-peace representatives actively criminalized by the government, and other opposition parties who are faced with the dilemma of betraying the informal political alliance in order to showcast popular patriotism. Moreover, another driver for the Turkish operation into Syria is the domestic politics involving the 3.6 million Syrian refugees residing in Turkey—the highest number of refugees hosted by any country—which has led to increasing public dissatisfaction and therefore public support and pressure for intervention. The negative sentiment against refugees among the Turkish electorate allows Erdogan and his AKP to benefit from moving refugees back to Syria. According to CrisisGroup analysis, this political strategy has cost AKP half of its conservative Kurds' supports since 2015.

### Immediate context rebuff
![Syrian Democratic Forces reduce fortifications DOD 107289224-5da7502c5a207.webm](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Redirect/file/Syrian_Democratic_Forces_reduce_fortifications_DOD_107289224-5da7502c5a207.webm?)
Turkey and the United States struck a deal in August 2019 after months of Turkish threats to unilaterally invade northern Syria. The United States viewed the [Syrian Democratic Forces](./Syrian_Democratic_Forces) as one of its key allies in the [military intervention against ISIL](./military_intervention_against_ISIL) in Syria, while Turkey viewed the group as an extension of the [Kurdistan Workers Party](./Kurdistan_Workers_Party) (PKK), which it considers a terrorist group. The agreement established the [Northern Syria Buffer Zone](./Northern_Syria_Buffer_Zone), which aimed to reduce tensions by addressing Turkey's security concerns with monitoring and joint patrols, while still allowing the NES to retain control over the areas that it had under its control at that time. The agreement was received favorably by the U.S. and SDF, but Turkey was generally dissatisfied with it. Turkey's dissatisfaction led to numerous Turkish efforts to expand the area covered by the buffer zone, secure Turkish control over parts of it, or relocate millions of refugees into the zone, with all of these efforts failing in the face of firm SDF resistance and American ambivalence.

Despite the official start of U.S.-Turkish ground patrols, the dismantling of SDF fortifications, and the withdrawal of [YPG](./YPG) units from parts of the buffer zone, tensions continued to rise as Turkey levied yet more demands on the SDF—all of which the SDF denied, as they felt they had accepted a harsh compromise by permitting Turkish troops to take part in joint patrols with their American counterparts in northern Syria. Turkey's dissatisfaction with the status quo of the agreement grew into open hostility, with the Turkish president openly posing an ultimatum against the SDF. The ultimatum was ignored by the group and Turkey declared its "deadline" to have expired at the start of October that same year.

## Prelude
![Turkish patrol](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Redirect/file/Turkish_patrol.jpg?)
Preparations for the offensive began in July 2019  and the final preparation in October, starting with the [withdrawal of American forces](./American-led_intervention_in_the_Syrian_Civil_War#Withdrawal_from_northeastern_Syria) from positions near the Turkish border, after Turkish President [Recep Tayyip Erdoğan](./Recep_Tayyip_Erdoğan) had a phone call with United States President [Donald Trump](./Donald_Trump) about plans for a military operation against SDF-held areas east of the Euphrates river. While the U.S. government stated it did not support the Turkish-led offensive, the White House also announced on 6 October 2019 that it would not interfere, and would withdraw all personnel in the area to avoid a potential U.S.-Turkish standoff; U.S. Secretary of State [Mike Pompeo](./Mike_Pompeo) denied that this amounted to giving Turkish forces a "green light" to attack the SDF while a spokesman for the SDF called the U.S. withdrawal a betrayal. The US also reportedly cut off aid to the SDF in order not to arm them against a [NATO ally](./Member_states_of_NATO).

On 8 October 2019, the Turkish military reportedly bombed a convoy of weapons vehicles heading from [Iraq](./Iraq) into Syria destined for the SDF. However the SDF did not retaliate and no casualties were reported as a result of the air strike. On the same day [Russian special forces](./Special_Operations_Forces_(Russia)) opened a crossing on the Euphrates river between areas held by the Syrian Government and SDF in the [Deir ez-Zor Governorate](./Deir_ez-Zor_Governorate). While the SDF stated that the Syrian military was preparing to enter the city of [Manbij](./Manbij) in northeastern [Aleppo](./Aleppo_Governorate), the Syrian government responded by saying the build up of the Syrian military near Manbij was being done in order to prevent the Turkish military from entering the city. On the same day, Turkish forces shelled [Ras al-Ayn](./Ras_al-Ayn) and fired machine guns in the vicinity of the city.

### 9 October 2019
The operation began on 9 October 2019, with Turkish [airstrikes](./airstrike) and [howitzers](./howitzer) targeting the [SDF](./Syrian_Democratic_Forces)-held towns of [Tell Abyad](./Tell_Abyad), [Ras al-Ayn](./Ras_al-Ayn) where thousands of people were reported to have fled the town, [Ayn Issa](./Ayn_Issa) and [Qamishli](./Qamishli). The start of the incursion was symbolic, as it was the 21st anniversary of the [PKK](./Kurdistan_Workers'_Party) leader [Abdullah Öcalan](./Abdullah_Öcalan)'s expulsion from Syria in 1998 by the [government](./Presidency_of_Hafez_al-Assad) of [Hafez al-Assad](./Hafez_al-Assad).

In response to the cross-border shelling, SDF's spokesman stated that Turkey was targeting civilians. Six rockets were later launched at the Turkish city of [Nusaybin](./Nusaybin) as a response by the YPG, and two reportedly hit the Turkish town [Ceylanpınar](./Ceylanpınar). The SDF also announced in response to the start of the Turkish operation they would be halting anti-ISIL operations, and that two civilians had been killed. In response to the airstrikes, the SDF has called upon the United States to establish a no-fly zone over northern Syria.

During the day, under pressure from Congressmen and public opinion, Trump sent a letter to Erdoğan proposing to make a deal, otherwise he would destroy the Turkish economy. Erdoğan took offense to the letter, reportedly throwing it in the trash. The White House released the letter to the press on 16 October, receiving wide ridicule.

#### Ground offensive
By the end of the day, the Turkish military announced that the ground phase of the operation had begun from three points including [Tell Abyad](./Tell_Abyad).

### 10 October 2019
![Barış Pınarı Harekâtı sonrası Kamışlı'dan yükselen dumanların Nusaybin'den görüntüsü](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Redirect/file/Bar%C4%B1%C5%9F_P%C4%B1nar%C4%B1_Harek%C3%A2t%C4%B1_sonras%C4%B1_Kam%C4%B1%C5%9Fl%C4%B1'dan_y%C3%BCkselen_dumanlar%C4%B1n_Nusaybin'den_g%C3%B6r%C3%BCnt%C3%BCs%C3%BC.jpg?)
Before dawn on the morning of 10 October 2019, the Turkish military officially began the ground offensive against the SDF; they also announced they had hit 181 targets in northern Syria, and 14,000 rebels backed by Turkey, including [Ahrar al-Sharqiya](./Ahrar_al-Sharqiya) rebel group, [Sultan Murad Division](./Sultan_Murad_Division), and [Hamza Division](./Hamza_Division_(Aleppo)), are also taking part in the Turkish-led offensive. According to a research paper published this October by the pro-government Turkish think tank [SETA](./Foundation_for_Political,_Economic_and_Social_Research), "Out of the 28 factions [in the [Syrian National Army](./Syrian_National_Army)], 21 were previously supported by the United States, three of them via the Pentagon’s program to combat DAESH. Eighteen of these factions were supplied by the [CIA](./CIA) via the MOM Operations Room in Turkey, a joint intelligence operation room of the 'Friends of Syria' to support the armed opposition. Fourteen factions of the 28 were also recipients of the U.S.-supplied [TOW](./BGM-71_TOW) anti-tank guided missiles."

The SDF said they repelled a Turkish advance into Tell Abyad. Later during the day, clashes reportedly broke out between the SDF and Turkish-aligned forces near [al-Bab](./al-Bab). Turkish-led forces made advances around the area of Tell Abyad and captured the villages of Tabatin and Al-Mushrifah. By nightfall Turkish Armed Forces declared control of 11 villages. As fighting went on around Tell Abyad, the Syrian National Army announced it captured the villages of Mishrifah, Al-Hawi, Barzan, Haj Ali and a farm east of the city. During Turkish air strikes during the fighting, SDF stated that the Turkish air force hit a prison that was holding captured ISIL fighters. Turkish media reported in the late evening that 174 SDF fighters were killed, wounded or captured.

Turkish President [Recep Tayyip Erdoğan](./Recep_Tayyip_Erdoğan) stated that day that 109 SDF fighters had been killed in the operation as well as an unspecified number of fighters wounded and captured. In a speech to lawmakers from Erdoğan's [AKP](./Justice_and_Development_Party_(Turkey)), the Turkish president also threatened to flood Europe with 3.6 million refugees if European nations continued to criticize the military operation, in particular if they labelled it an invasion.

70,000 people fled from border towns in the SDF following Turkish bombardment.

According to Turkey's [Ministry of National Defence](./Ministry_of_National_Defence_(Turkey)), one Turkish soldier was killed by the YPG.

In the city of [Qamishli](./Qamishli), a suspected ISIL car bomb killed five civilians, while a reported Turkish artillery strike hit a nearby prison, and five suspected ISIL members, previously detained in SDF custody, escaped according to SDF.

In the city of [Kobanî](./Kobanî), the area immediately around a U.S. special forces base experienced heavy shelling by Turkish artillery; the U.S. troops did not retaliate, but withdrew after the shelling ended. Turkey responded by denying that it targeted the U.S. base, instead stating that it had fired upon SDF positions. [The Pentagon](./The_Pentagon) further raised concerns that the [Turkish Army](./Turkish_Land_Forces) deliberately "bracketed" US Forces stationed in Kobanî with artillery fire. According to Turkish Defense Minister, the mortar attack targeting the town of [Suruç](./Suruç) earlier in the day was deliberately launched 1000 meters from the US base in Kobanî by SDF to avoid Turkish retaliation and the attack was in response.

The [BBC](./BBC) reported that 100,000 people have fled their homes in northern Syria. The [Kurdish Red Crescent](./Kurdish_Red_Crescent) (*Heyva Sor*) said there had been 11 confirmed civilian deaths so far.

Around 12:00 ([UTC+03:00](./UTC+03:00)), the TAF and SNA stated they had captured [Ras al-Ayn](./Ras_al-Ayn), but the SDF denied that Turkey had taken control of the city.

Turkish-backed members of Islamist militia [Ahrar al-Sharqiya](./Ahrar_al-Sharqiya) executed [Hevrin Khalaf](./Hevrin_Khalaf), Secretary General of the Future Syria Party. Nine civilians, including Khalaf, were executed by the Ahrar al-Sharqiya fighters at a roadblock on the M4 highway south of Tal Abyad. Turkish news source Yeni Safak reported that Khalaf was "neutralized" in a "successful operation" against a politician affiliated with a "terrorist" organization. Her execution was widely described by Western sources as a [war crime](./war_crime) under [international law](./international_law). A spokesman for [Ahrar al-Sharqiya](./Ahrar_al-Sharqiya) meanwhile announced that she was killed for being "an agent for U.S. intelligence".

A Bellingcat video solidly traces the killings to rebels backed by Turkey Ahrar al-Sharqiya.

On 17 October 2019, US Vice President [Mike Pence](./Mike_Pence) and Turkish President [Recep Tayyip Erdoğan](./Recep_Tayyip_Erdoğan) reached a deal to implement a 120-hour cease-fire for Turkey's operation in northern Syria to allow SDF to withdraw from a designated safe zone,  spanning from the Turkey-Syria border to 20 miles (32 km) south. Mike Pence stated that once the military operation completely stops all sanctions imposed on Turkey by the United States would be lifted and there would be no further sanctions. According to a US statement, the safe zone would be "primarily enforced by the Turkish Armed Forces". This ceasefire deal was described as another US betrayal of the Kurds and a Kurdish surrender to Turkey  by several US commentators and officials.

Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu stated that it is not a ceasefire but a temporary pause to allow SDF to withdraw from the designated safe zone, after which if completed the operation would end and if not completed the operation would continue. The SDF commander Mazloum Abdi said that they accepted the ceasefire agreement only in the area between [Tall Abyad](./Tall_Abyad) and [Ras al-Ayn](./Ras_al-Ayn).

The Syrian Kurdish politician [Salih Muslim](./Salih_Muslim) stated that "Our people did not want this war. We welcome the ceasefire, but we will defend ourselves in the event of any attack … Ceasefire is one thing and surrender is another thing, and we are ready to defend ourselves. We will not accept the occupation of northern Syria."

### During the ceasefire


#### 18 October 2019
Cautious calm prevailed at the east of Euphrates on 18 October according to SOHR with minor clashes in besieged [Ras al-Ayn](./Ras_al-Ayn). The SDF said Turkey was violating the ceasefire and of shelling civilian areas of Ras al-Ayn. An unnamed US official said the following day that Turkish backed forces had violated the ceasefire, and the SDF had stopped fighting.

Turkey announced it aimed to establish 12 "observation posts" in its safe zone, with President Erdoğan stating that Turkey will respond if the Syrian government "makes a mistake".

#### 19 October 2019
SDF had not withdrawn from any positions east of [Euphrates](./Euphrates_River) despite the passage of 37 hours of the US-Turkish agreement to suspend the Turkish military operation for 120 hours according to SOHR. SOHR also reported that since the start of the operation, Turkish Armed Forces and allies had captured an area of 2419 km2. Both sides said the other side was violating the ceasefire, SDF stated that Turkish forces prevented medical aid from reaching Ras al-Ain, the statement was backed by SOHR. Unnamed US officials said the "ceasefire is not holding". In the afternoon the SDF said an aid convoy had been let through, after having been prevented from entering the town since Thursday.

#### 20 October 2019


##### SDF withdraws from Ras al-Ayn

![Operation Peace Spring - Ras Al Ayn](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Redirect/file/Operation_Peace_Spring_-_Ras_Al_Ayn.svg?)
A Turkish soldier was killed by a mortar attack near [Tal Abyad](./Tal_Abyad) due to violations of [YPG](./YPG) according to Turkish Defense Ministry, whilst the SDF stated that 16 fighters had been killed by Turkish forces. SDF fully withdrew from [Ras al-Ayn](./Ras_al-Ayn) alongside the aid convoy per SOHR. Both sides have stated that the other side made ceasefire violations.

##### Continued U.S. withdrawal
US forces withdrew from their [[airbase](./Operation_Inherent_Resolve#Military_bases)](./Operation_Inherent_Resolve#Military_bases) near [Sarrin](./Sarrin) as well as their airbase near [Tell Beydar](./Tell_Beydar) and destroyed it per SOHR. US forces have completely withdrew from the countrysides of [Aleppo](./Aleppo_Governorate) and [Raqqa](./Raqqa_Governorate) per SDC. In the largest ground move to date, a United States convoy of almost 500 personnel is moving eastward through northern Syria towards the border of Iraq. As they withdrew, locals threw rotten produce and shouted insults at them, demonstrating a sense of betrayal among the populace.

U.S. President Donald Trump favored leaving a contingent of 200–300 US troops in [Deir ez-Zur countryside](./Deir_ez-Zor_Governorate) of eastern Syria where majority of the country's [oil fields](./oil_fields) are located per [NYT](./The_New_York_Times) and [WSJ](./The_Wall_Street_Journal). The SDF, however, stated that "The fields have stayed in our hands. We have an agreement with the [Syrian] regime to give them some of our positions along the Turkish border, but we have not negotiated with them on the oil fields yet. There will probably be a version of joint control and revenue sharing with the regime from these fields. I don’t know if Trump understands this."

#### 21 October 2019
The SOHR reported continued ceasefire violations despite the withdrawal of the SDF from [Ras al-Ayn](./Ras_al-Ayn). Per SOHR, Turkish [drone strikes](./drone_strike) had targeted a vehicle carrying 4 members of the SDF near [Ain Issa](./Ayn_Issa), resulting in the death of all fighters. The Abu Rasin area, east of Ras al-Ayn also experienced heavy clashes and shelling by Turkey as per SOHR.

On the aftermath of the SDF withdrawal from the Ras al-Ayn, there were widespread accounts of looting, theft, burning of houses and kidnappings by the pro-Turkish forces with documented examples of members of the [Hamza Division](./Hamza_Division_(Aleppo)) per to the SOHR.

The SOHR reported a US withdrawal from northern Syria with a military convoy passing through Simalka border into Iraq at midnight.

#### 22 October 2019
Russian Defense Minister [Sergei Shoigu](./Sergei_Shoigu) has stated that Russia would need to deploy additional troops and equipment to Syria to patrol the border. As the deadline of the US-brokered 120-hour ceasefire agreement was nearing, Shoigu further stated that the US had less than two hours to comply with the agreement (i.e., removing the sanctions against Turkey) and suggested that the US forces had until the end of the 120-hour period to withdraw from Syria.

According to Syrian state news channel Al-Ekhbaria, Syrian President Assad has told Russian President Putin that his government rejects the occupation of Syria's lands under any pretext in a phone call today. In a reference to the SDF during his visit to the war zone near Al-Habeet in Idlib, the Syrian President Assad stated that "We said we are ready to support any group that takes up popular resistance against Erdogan and Turkey. This is not a political decision, we have not made a political decision, this is a constitutional duty and this is a national duty. If we don't do this, we don't deserve the homeland."

U.S. senator [Mitch McConnell](./Mitch_McConnell) introduced a resolution in opposition to President Trump's withdrawal from Syria.

[Jim Jeffrey](./Jim_Jeffrey), US special envoy for Syria and the global coalition against ISIL, said that he was not consulted or advised in advance about the withdrawal of the US from Syria.

##### Russian–Turkish memorandum
On 22 October 2019, Russian President [Vladimir Putin](./Vladimir_Putin) and Turkish President [Recep Tayyip Erdoğan](./Recep_Tayyip_Erdoğan) met in [Sochi](./Sochi) and [reached an agreement](./Second_Northern_Syria_Buffer_Zone) about the situation in Syria. They subsequently released a 10-point memorandum detailing the provisions of the agreement.

In the agreement, the established status quo of the Operation Peace Spring area, covering Tell Abyad and Ras Al Ayn with a depth of 32 kilometers from the border, will be maintained. Starting from 12.00 noon on 23 October, Russian military police and Syrian border guards will enter the Syrian border territory outside the Operation Peace Spring area to facilitate the removal of the YPG in the area with a depth of 30 kilometers from the border, which should be finalized within 150 hours. Hereafter, joint Russian–Turkish patrols will start to the west and east of the Operation Peace Spring area to a depth of 10 kilometers from the border, excluding [Qamishli](./Qamishli) city. The YPG will be removed from both [Manbij](./Manbij) and [Tal Rifat](./Tell_Rifaat).

Russian President Putin informed Syrian President Assad about the provisions of the deal in a phone call. The Russian government announced that Assad voiced his support for the agreement and was ready to deploy the Syrian border guards in line with the agreement.

#### 23 October 2019
President Trump announced that there was a 'permanent' ceasefire in the region and sanctions on Turkey would therefore be lifted, but he also added that the word 'permanent' is questionable for that part of the world. US lawmakers publicly criticized Trump's decision to lift the sanctions.

[Dmitry Peskov](./Dmitry_Peskov), the Russian presidential press secretary, urged the Kurdish forces to withdraw from Syria's border namely because the Syrian border guards and Russian military police would have to step back otherwise, adding that the remaining Kurdish units would be 'steamrolled' by the Turkish military, and stated that the United States had both betrayed and abandoned them despite being their closest ally in recent years.

As [*Newsweek*](./Newsweek) first reported, it's stated that the United States is considering and preparing to deploy tanks and troops to defend the oil in eastern Syria. Even though the stated purpose is preventing ISIL from regaining the oil fields, it is likely as much an effort to block Syria and Russia.

#### 24 October 2019
Syria's state news agency [SANA](./SANA) reported that Turkish troops and allied fighters attacked Syrian army positions outside [Tal Tamr](./Tal_Tamr), resulting in several Syrian casualties as they fought back, and clashed with Kurdish-led fighters. The SOHR also confirmed clashes between the SDF and the Syrian National Army near Tal Tamr. The Kurdish-led SDF said that three of its troops were killed during the fighting with the Syrian National Army.

Russia carried out several airstrikes in the Syrian rebel-held territory, targeting the [Idlib](./Idlib_Governorate), [Hama](./Hama_Governorate), and [Latakia](./Latakia_Governorate) provinces among comments by analysts that Idlib, the remaining Turkey-supported rebel stronghold, was the Syrian government's next target.

During the NATO meeting, Germany's Defense Minister [Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer](./Annegret_Kramp-Karrenbauer) had presented a proposal for an internationally monitored security zone in northeast Syria to be mandated by the United Nations. The following day, the Russian Foreign Minister [Sergey Lavrov](./Sergey_Lavrov) rejected the idea of a NATO-controlled security zone in Syria. On 26 October, the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu also rejected the German plan for an international security zone and said that the proposal was not realistic.

#### 25 October 2019
US Defense Secretary [Mark Esper](./Mark_Esper) said the United States would send their troops, including 'mechanized' forces, to defend the oil in eastern Syria to keep it from ISIL. It is unclear whether the Kurds would welcome the Americans again in the aftermath of the US withdrawal, as Syrian Kurdish leader Ilham Ahmed commented earlier on 24 October that "If the U.S. presence in the area is not going to benefit us when it comes to stability, security, and [stopping] the genocide and ethnic cleansing, they won’t be welcomed."

The Russian Defense Ministry has announced that around 300 Russian military police have arrived in Syria. The military police, from the Russian region of [Chechnya](./Chechnya), will patrol the border region and help with the withdrawal of the Kurdish forces from the border region.

#### 26 October 2019
The Turkish President Erdogan said that "If this area is not cleared from terrorists at the end of the 150 hours, then we will handle the situation by ourselves and will do all the cleansing work." The Turkish president also criticized the European Union of lying to provide the 6 billion euros to help house and feed around 3.6 million Syrian refugees residing in Turkey, while stating that the EU only provided half of the promised amount and adding that Turkey has spent around 40 billion euros. He warned that Turkey will open its border for the refugees to go to Europe if European countries failed to provide more financial support for the return of the refugees to Syria.

A U.S. military convoy drove south of Qamishli heading towards the oil fields in Deir el-Zour. The SOHR also reported the convoy when it earlier arrived from Iraq. Major General [Igor Konashenkov](./Igor_Konashenkov), the Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, characterized the US actions to send armored vehicles and combat troops to protect the oil in eastern Syria as 'banditry'. The Russian Foreign Minister [Sergei Lavrov](./Sergei_Lavrov) spoke with the US Secretary of State [Mike Pompeo](./Mike_Pompeo) about Syria, with the Russian side emphasizing the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria according to the Russian public statement.

A large convoy of Syrian government troops was deployed to eight villages at the Ras al-Ayn area along the M4 highway and close to the Syrian–Turkish border.

Casualties were reported after clashes in Tal Tamr and Ras al-Ayn, nine dead among the pro-Turkish forces and six dead among the SDF.

#### 27 October 2019
The SDF released a statement saying: "The SDF is redeploying to new positions away from the Turkish–Syrian border across northeast Syria in accordance with the terms of the agreement in order to stop the bloodshed and to protect the inhabitants of the region from Turkish attacks."

#### 29 October 2019
The SOHR reported reoccurring clashes between joint Syrian–SDF forces and Turkish-led forces in the area between Tal Tamr and Ras al-Ayn. During the clashes along the border, Turkish forces reportedly killed 6 Syrian soldiers near Ras al-Ayn. Meantime, Turkish Ministry of National Defense announced that they have captured 18 persons who stated to be Syrian government forces.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu announced that the Kurdish-led armed forces had withdrawn from the safe zone along the Syria–Turkey border.

## Post-ceasefire activity


### Diplomatic relations
In a press statement addressed to the SDF, the Syrian Defense Ministry announced that they will accept any unit who is willing to join the Syrian military in a joint effort to battle invading Turkish troops and the Turkish-supported Syrian rebels, and offers reconciliation to those not needed for security. The Syrian Interior Ministry offered civil services across the northeast, as they described the difficult living conditions due to the Turkish-led incursion. They also offered to integrate the Asayesh security forces of the SDF into the government's internal security agency. The Syrian Education Ministry offered to support the children, as they described that children are deprived of schooling due to the unrest.

In response, the SDF said that they appreciate the efforts to unify Syria's defense and repel the Turkish aggression but also stated: "Our position was clear from the beginning, wherein uniting the ranks should begin from a political settlement that recognizes and preserves the exclusivity of the SDF and its structure, and creates a sound mechanism for restructuring the Syrian military establishment as an overarching framework for unifying efforts."

### Situation around the safe zone
On 31 October, the Turkish President Erdogan announces that the joint Turkish-Russian patrols in northeast Syria will begin on Friday. On 1 November 2019, Turkish and Russian forces started joint patrol.

There have been intermittent clashes between Syrian government troops and Turkish-backed forces around Ras al-Ain and Tal Tamr. Turkey returned 18 Syrian government soldiers who were captured by Turkish-backed Syrian fighters south of Ras al-Ayn amidst growing tensions between Syria and Turkey. The Turkish Defense Ministry announced the handover on 1 November.

## War crimes
![Rojava solidarity demonstration Berlin 2019-10-10 22](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Redirect/file/Rojava_solidarity_demonstration_Berlin_2019-10-10_22.jpg?)
Syrian Kurdish authorities and doctors have reported about a number of patients with severe burns seemingly caused by a chemical weapon, accusing Turkey of employing the chemical [white phosphorus](./white_phosphorus) to target people. Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, a former commander of the UK's chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear regiment, said of wounds he had been shown pictures of, "the most likely culprit is white phosphorus". Syrian Kurdish authorities also criticized Turkey for using napalm.

The [Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons](./Organisation_for_the_Prohibition_of_Chemical_Weapons) (OPCW) has stated that they are aware of the situation and are collecting information over the reported use of chemical weapons but cautioned that they have not yet determined the credibility of the allegations. The SOHR stated they could not confirm the use of napalm or white phosphorus.

The OPCW has refused to launch an investigation into the alleged use of white phosphorus by Turkish forces, arguing that the issue falls outside their remit as white phosphorus injuries are produced by [thermal](./Thermal_burn) rather than [chemical](./Chemical_burn) properties. They also remarked that "White phosphorus is commonly used in military operations to produce smoke or provide illumination. When white phosphorus is used as smoke, illumination or as an [incendiary weapon](./Incendiary_device), its use does not fall under the purview of the [Chemical Weapons Convention](./Chemical_Weapons_Convention)".

[Amnesty International](./Amnesty_International) stated that it had gathered evidence of war crimes and other violations committed by Turkish and Turkey-backed Syrian forces who are said to "have displayed a shameful disregard for civilian life, carrying out serious violations and war crimes, including [summary killings](./Summary_execution) and unlawful attacks that have killed and injured civilians".

Numerous video footage and photographs have emerged where Syrian rebel forces are seen committing executions and other war crimes. [Jim Jeffrey](./Jim_Jeffrey), the US envoy for Syria and the global coalition against ISIL, has stated in a hearing before the US [Senate Foreign Relations Committee](./United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Foreign_Relations) that they have seen several incidents which they consider war crimes committed by the Turkish-supported Syrian opposition forces, and characterized these groups as very dangerous and even extremist in some cases. In a [US House Foreign Affairs Committee](./United_States_House_Committee_on_Foreign_Affairs) hearing, he stated that they have reached out to the Turkish government to discuss the war crimes committed by the Turkish-supported opposition.

[Hevrin Khalaf](./Hevrin_Khalaf), a Syrian Kurdish political leader, and other people, was summarily executed by the armed faction [Ahrar al-Sharqiya](./Ahrar_al-Sharqiya). UN human rights spokesman Rupert Colville stated that "Turkey could be deemed responsible as a State for violations committed by their affiliated armed groups, as long as Turkey exercises effective control over these groups, or the operations in the course of which those violations occurred. [...] we urge the Turkish authorities to immediately launch an impartial, transparent and independent investigation into both incidents, and to apprehend those responsible, some of whom should be easily identifiable from the video footage they themselves shared on social media." According to Committee on Violations under the Ministry of Defence of [Syrian Interim Government](./Syrian_Interim_Government), the perpetrators were detained and sent to the military judiciary. Turkish Foreign Minister [Mevlut Cavusoglu](./Mevlut_Cavusoglu) has responded that Turkey will investigate any allegation of human rights violations in the region and will not tolerate any human rights violation.

Members of the pro-Turkish [Levant Front](./Levant_Front) also evicted Christians from their homes in [Tell Abyad](./Tell_Abyad), though left the local Kurds mostly alone.

### Reports by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights
According to the [Syrian Observatory for Human Rights](./Syrian_Observatory_for_Human_Rights) (SOHR), Turkish backed forces have looted countless homes in Ras al-Ayn and Tal Abyad have engaged in theft of property, physical, and verbal abuse, kidnappings of civilians for ransom and abuse against the citizens who did not flee. According to the report some civilians, unable to flee, paid smugglers $300 in order to be delivered to the nearest point of the [Autonomous Administration areas](./Autonomous_Administration_of_North_and_East_Syria) (Rojava) at which point they were handed over to Turkish intelligence as members of the SDF after their money was taken from them.

A report by SOHR states that Turkish backed factions began demolishing houses in Kormazat villages of local [Kurds](./Kurds) who fled from fighting as well as members of the SDF from [Tal Abyad](./Tal_Abyad), as well as taking barley in Abu Julud village in Mabrukah area in the western countryside of Ras Al-Ayn.

### Population displacement
SOHR states that the number of displaced people exceeds 300,000 amid the humanitarian crisis and conflict. People have fled towards the autonomous Kurdish region within the border of Iraq.

[Ibrahim Kalin](./Ibrahim_Kalin), a Turkish presidential spokesman, has stated that they do not want Syrian government or Kurdish forces in the Syrian border areas but intend Turkey to oversee the region. He further said that Turkey intends to resettle up to 2 million Syrian refugees, currently in Turkey, who will not go back if these areas are under the control of either of these forces.

In response to European criticism, Turkish President Erdoğan warned that Turkey will "open the gates" for 3.6 million refugees who are currently in Turkey to go to Europe if its military operation is called an invasion. This comes under the context that Europe has employed foreign countries such as Turkey to serve as border guards, in a policy of border externalization.

Amnesty International remarked that Turkey "has borne a disproportionate responsibility" hosting 3.6 million refugees from Syria while European countries "have largely devoted their energies to keeping people seeking asylum from their territories" including not resettling the refugees residing in Turkey, the tensions between Turkish citizens and Syrian refugees are rising, and the decline in Turkish public support for refugees has led to an expression in policies where the Turkish government aims to resettle its Syrian refugee population in a demilitarized safe zone with the 2019 military operation as the latest development.

Amnesty International has reported that Turkey is illegally and forcibly deporting its Syrian refugees back to Syria while portraying the returns as voluntary. Hami Aksoy, a Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman, stated that Turkey rejects Amnesty International's statements about the forceful repatriation and underscores that Turkey is conducting the safe and voluntary return of Syrians.

There are fears of [ethnic cleansing](./ethnic_cleansing) of the Kurds from the region.

Jens Laerke, spokesman for the [United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs](./United_Nations_Office_for_the_Coordination_of_Humanitarian_Affairs) said that 94,000 civilians have returned to their homes, while 100,000 are still displaced.

### ISIL prisoners
There are concerns about a possible resurgence of the [Islamic State](./Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant) (ISIL) in the region, as the Kurdish-led [Syrian Democratic Forces](./Syrian_Democratic_Forces) (SDF)—who conducted counter-terrorism operations against ISIL and held the ISIL captives in the region—fight against the Turkish-led offensive and thus could lose control over the detainees. There are at least 10,000 ISIL prisoners and more than 100,000 ISIL family members and other displaced persons in several camps across northeastern Syria. A number of the ISIL detainees are foreign fighters, but their status have become increasingly uncertain due to the Turkish offensive as their own countries refuse to take them. As the threat of ISIL emerged as consequence, European countries have been criticized for failing to act by taking back their nationals, while the situation deteriorates. When asked about the situation after the US withdrawal from Syria, US President [Donald Trump](./Donald_Trump) dismissed the threat of ISIL, remarking that "they're going to be escaping to Europe".

[Îlham Ehmed](./Îlham_Ehmed), a Syrian Kurdish official, stated that the SDF felt betrayed by their American allies for "exposing us to an invasion by Turkish troops who aim to destroy us", remarking that they do not have the resources to both defend against the Turkish attacks and maintain security over the ISIL captives. Nevertheless, as stated by [Jim Jeffrey](./Jim_Jeffrey), the US special envoy for Syria and the global coalition against ISIL, on 23 October, almost all of the prisons that the SDF were guarding are still secured and the SDF still have people there. The SDF commander Mazloum Abdi said, on 21 October, that there aren't any prisons in the Turkish-occupied areas and that all prisoners from those areas have been moved to prisons under their control.

As a consequence of the US withdrawal and the Turkish offensive, the SDF will be more restricted in time and resources to help the United States in the fight against ISIL, as it is also focused on the threat from the Turkish forces and the preservation of its autonomy against Syria and Russia.

According to Turkish sources, the SDF freed ISIL prisoners from a prison in [Tal Abyad](./Tal_Abyad) before Turkish forces could arrive. Other US officials, however, refuted the accusations, which they called baseless and false. They stated that the SDF are still defending their bases and are relocating ISIL detainees to facilities further south. They also reported that the [Syrian National Army](./Syrian_National_Army) is purposefully releasing ISIL prisoners, previously held by the SDF before their territory was captured.

At least 750 ISIL affiliates were reported by the SDF to have escaped from a displacement camp in [Ayn Issa](./Ayn_Issa) after Turkish bombing on 13 October 2019. On 23 October, Jim Jeffrey stated that over 100 prisoners of ISIL have escaped and that they do not know where the escapees are.

On 18 October, [Turkish Ministry of National Defense](./Ministry_of_National_Defense_(Turkey)) claimed that [YPG](./YPG) had freed over 800 [ISIL](./ISIL) prisoners in [Tal Abyad](./Tal_Abyad).

On 19 November, the Defense Department inspector general released a report finding that the American withdrawal and subsequent Turkish incursion allowed ISIL to "reconstitute capabilities and resources within Syria and strengthen its ability to plan attacks abroad".

## Reactions
![Reactions to Turkey's 2019 Rojava offensive](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Redirect/file/Reactions_to_Turkey's_2019_Rojava_offensive.svg?)


### Domestic Turkish reaction
The Turkish offensive initially enjoyed support from party leaders across the political spectrum, with the support of three major opposition parties, but not the [Peoples' Democratic Party](./Peoples'_Democratic_Party_(Turkey)) (HDP). Opposition newsrooms and opposition parties were largely supportive of the operation. However, as time progressed, the Turkish opposition began criticizing the governmental strategy. Opposition [Republican People's Party](./Republican_People's_Party_(Turkey)) leader [Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu](./Kemal_Kılıçdaroğlu) blamed the government's "adventurous foreign policy", stating that "If I do not respect the territorial integrity of another government, I will make enemies. Today we have made all the world as our enemies." Meanwhile, opposition [İyi Party](./İyi_Party) leader [Meral Akşener](./Meral_Akşener) urged the government to dialogue with Assad in order to make peace while criticizing President Erdoğan for his silence on U.S. sanctions.

According to a research by Metropoll, the amount of support to the operation was at 79 percent, while [Operation Olive Branch](./Operation_Olive_Branch) had 71 percent support according to the poll before.

#### Detainments in Turkey
Turkish police detained more than 120 online critics of the Turkish operation for spreading "terrorist propaganda". Turkish prosecutors opened investigations against MPs [Sezai Temelli](./Sezai_Temelli) and [Pervin Buldan](./Pervin_Buldan), co-leaders of the pro-Kurdish [HDP](./Peoples'_Democratic_Party_(Turkey)) party. Turkey detained at least 151 members of the HDP, including district officials, and at least 4 HDP mayors for reported links to the [PKK](./PKK), which Turkey considers to be a terrorist group. Turkish authorities have also detained web editor of opposition [*BirGün*](./BirGün) newspaper (who was later released) and managing editor of the online news portal [*Diken*](./Diken_(newspaper)).

The government launched a domestic campaign to eradicate dissenting opinions from media, social media, streets actions or any civil parties opposing the military operation. On 10 October, Turkey's broadcasting regulatory body [RTÜK](./RTÜK) warned media that "any broadcasting that may negatively impact the morale and motivation of the soldiers or may mislead citizens through incomplete, falsified or partial information that serves the aims of terror". Social media dissidents, journalists, protesters have been criticized of "terrorism" and harassed via criminal investigation, arbitrary detention and travel bans. Dissidents face lengthy prison sentences if found guilty.

#### Controversy in Northern Cyprus
On 12 October [President of Northern Cyprus](./President_of_Northern_Cyprus), [Mustafa Akıncı](./Mustafa_Akıncı) made "anti-war" remarks in response to the operation, in which, although defending the right of Turkey to defend itself, said that in all wars there will be much bloodshed. Erdoğan as well as [VP](./Vice_President_of_Turkey) [Fuat Oktay](./Fuat_Oktay) condemned Akıncı's statement. While [Prime Minister of Northern Cyprus](./Prime_Minister_of_Northern_Cyprus), [Ersin Tatar](./Ersin_Tatar)'s [National Unity Party](./National_Unity_Party_(Northern_Cyprus)) attempted to get a resolution through the legislature that condemned Akıncı, and called for his resignation for his statement. Akıncı also received a slew of death threats, and filed a complaint on 17 October to the police. Erdoğan said that Akıncı's legitimacy is thanks to Turkey, and should therefore support Turkey. Akıncı rebuked Erdogan, stating "There is only one authority decides how to get to this office, it's the Turkish Cypriot people".

### Sanctions and suspension of arms sales


#### European Union

On 10 October, a large majority of Dutch MPs backed the introduction of sanctions against Turkey. France, Germany, Sweden, Finland, and Norway implemented export restrictions on arms exports to Turkey and France as well as Sweden expressed their intention to back an EU-wide weapons embargo on the nation, with discussions in the European Union on possible union-wide sanctions on Turkey beginning on the 13th. Italy, formerly Turkey's largest arms supplier, later joined the arms embargo against Turkey.

On 14 October, all EU countries agreed to stop selling arms to Turkey, but stopped short of an official union-wide arms embargo. The EU also issued a press release condemning "...Turkeyʼs unilateral military action in North East Syria which causes unacceptable human suffering, undermines the fight against Daʼesh and threatens heavily European security."

#### United States

![President Trump Meets with Congressional Leadership (48914066862)](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Redirect/file/President_Trump_Meets_with_Congressional_Leadership_(48914066862).jpg?)


Trump said he was working with congressional leaders, including the [Democratic](./Democratic_Party_(United_States)) opposition, to impose "powerful" economic sanctions against Turkey for its cross-border attacks in north-eastern Syria. Senator [Lindsey Graham](./Lindsey_Graham) warned that he would "introduce bipartisan sanctions against Turkey if they invade Syria". He said he would also "call for their suspension from [NATO](./NATO) if they attack Kurdish forces who assisted the United States in the destruction of the [ISIS Caliphate](./Islamic_State_of_Iraq_and_the_Levant)". Bipartisan legislation has been introduced in the [Senate](./United_States_Senate) to sanction Turkey, as well as in the [House of Representatives](./U.S._House_of_Representatives). On 14 October, the U.S. government declared sanctions against the Turkish ministries of defense, interior and energy. The U.S. statement delivered by Treasury Secretary [Steven Mnuchin](./Steven_Mnuchin) and Vice President [Mike Pence](./Mike_Pence) denounced the Turkish government for "endangering innocent civilians, and destabilizing the region, including undermining the campaign to defeat ISIS", said that the U.S. had not given a "green light" to a full-on Turkish invasion, and warned that sanctions would continue and worsen "until Turkey embraces an immediate ceasefire". On the same day, U.S. President Donald Trump demanded a ceasefire from Turkey in a conversation with Turkish President Erdoğan, froze negotiations on a $100bn US-Turkey trade deal, and imposed sanctions on Turkish government officials.

On 16 October, the United States House of Representatives, in a rare bipartisan vote of 354 to 60, "condemned" President Trump's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria, for, in the view of both parties, "abandoning U.S. allies, undermining the struggle against ISIS, and spurring a humanitarian catastrophe".

On 17 October, after reaching a ceasefire agreement with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, [US Vice President](./Vice_President_of_the_United_States) Mike Pence announced that all sanctions imposed on Turkey by the United States would be lifted and there would be no further sanctions once a permanent ceasefire was reached in the operation.

On 29 October 2019, the [U.S. House of Representatives](./U.S._House_of_Representatives) voted 405–11 to recognize the [Armenian genocide](./Armenian_genocide), as a result of Turkey's invasion of Syria. However, the motion was blocked in the [Senate](./United_States_Senate) by [South Carolina](./South_Carolina) [Republican](./Republican_Party_(United_States)) Senator [Lindsey Graham](./Lindsey_Graham), following a request from the White House. On 12 December 2019, the [Senate unanimously passed a resolution recognizing the Armenian genocide](./United_States_recognition_of_the_Armenian_genocide), after it had been previously blocked by three different Republican Senators (Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, [David Perdue](./David_Perdue) of [Georgia](./Georgia_(U.S._state)) and [Kevin Cramer](./Kevin_Cramer) of [North Dakota](./North_Dakota)) at the request of the White House.

### Media coverage
In Turkey, authorities such as the Chief Prosecutor's Office of Istanbul have been criticized of censoring critical reports of the Turkish offensive into Syria through detaining or harassing journalists in an attempt to "intimidate the media into silence". Furthermore, Turkish President Erdoğan has written op-eds about the Turkish offensive, which has been characterized as propagandist in nature.

Much of [western media](./western_media)'s coverage and commentary of the U.S.'s role in the conflict emphasized President Donald Trump's "strategic blunder" that led to the Turkish offensive, particularly his upending of the U.S.'s general alliance with the Syrian Kurds, the withdrawal process of U.S. ground forces, and the greater [geopolitical](./Geopolitics) and humanitarian impact of the offensive.

ABC News was criticized for incorrectly portraying footage from a [Kentucky](./Kentucky) gun range as footage of Turkish forces bombing Syrian territory in early October. This portrayal of the incident in the video was quickly debunked. The news network has since issued an apology for their mistake.

## Aftermath
In October 2019, in response to the Turkish offensive, Russia arranged for negotiations between the Syrian government in Damascus and the Kurdish-led forces. [Mazloum Abdi](./Mazloum_Abdi), the Syrian Kurdish commander-in-chief, announced that they are ready to partner with [Vladimir Putin](./Vladimir_Putin) (Russia) and [Bashar al-Assad](./Bashar_al-Assad) (Syria), stating that "We know that we would have to make painful compromises with Moscow and Bashar al-Assad if we go down the road of working with them. But if we have to choose between compromises and the genocide of our people, we will surely choose life for our people." The details of the agreement is unknown, but there are reports that suggest that the SDF will be incorporated into the [Syrian Armed Forces](./Syrian_Armed_Forces) and that northeastern Syria will come under direct rule of the Syrian government in Damascus. According to Syrian Kurdish officials, the deal allows Syrian government forces to take over security in some border areas, but their own administration would maintain control of local institutions.

The prospects for Kurdish autonomy in the region was severely diminished, because the Kurds were exposed to the Turkish-led offensive by the US withdrawal and the Russia-backed Syrian government forces under Assad—whose commonality is enmity towards Turkey and Sunni rebel militias—regained their foothold in northeast Syria after the Kurds had to seek their help. In regards to the United States and the situation, Mazloum Abdi stated that "We are disappointed and frustrated by the current crisis. Our people are under attack, and their safety is our paramount concern. Two questions remain: How can we best protect our people? And is the United States still our ally?" A deep sense of betrayal by their once American allies has come to be felt among the Syrian Kurdish populace.

As announced by Russia's Ministry of Defense on 15 October, Russian forces have started to patrol the region along the line of contact between Turkish and Syrian forces, indicating that Russia is filling the security vacuum from the sudden US withdrawal. Video footage shows Russian soldiers and journalists touring a base that the US left behind. Alexander Lavrentiev, Russia's special envoy on Syria, warned that the Turkish offensive into Syria is unacceptable and stated that Russia is seeking to prevent conflict between Turkish and Syrian troops.

Several US lawmakers have criticized the abandonment of their Kurdish allies, remarking that it undermines US credibility as an ally while benefiting Russia, Iran, and the Syrian regime of Assad. Meanwhile, several commentators in Moscow have stated that the situation is not in the immediate Russian interests, as the Turkish intervention in Syria clashes with Russia's backing of the Syrian government in the region, but it may provide opportunities for Russia as mediator as the US withdraws from Syria. Commentators have remarked that, since the US withdrawal, Russia has cemented its status as the key power broker in the Middle East.

Due to the situation in Syria, there are signs of a schism between Turkey and other [NATO](./NATO) members, in which NATO is seen as effectively "powerless" to manage the situation and the Turkish government is aware that NATO does not hold much leverage. Furthermore, US President Trump, as well as US military and diplomatic officials, has cited the NATO membership of Turkey as a key reason that the United States can not be involved in the conflict between the Turkish and Syrian Kurdish forces. Meanwhile, due to Turkey's strategic position between Europe and the Middle East, the NATO alliance members are in a situation where they have limited themselves to relatively muted criticism.

The U.S. is reviewing the potential withdrawal of its [nuclear weapons](./Nuclear_weapons_of_the_United_States) from [Incirlik airbase](./Incirlik_airbase) under NATO's [nuclear sharing](./nuclear_sharing) as a result of the Turkish offensive per [NYT](./The_New_York_Times). Republican senator Lindsey Graham and Democratic representative [Eric Swalwell](./Eric_Swalwell) have called for possibly suspending Turkey's membership in NATO.

On 9 December, Russian troops entered Raqqa and began distributing humanitarian aid.

### Turkish actions
Erdogan stated that Turkey was ready to resettle the Syrian refugees in the northern area that Turkey had invaded, and that Turkey would pay for it if necessary. On 9 December 2019, various local accounts indicated that Turkey was moving Syrian refugees into its zone of operations in Northern Syria for the first time. Erdogan said that Turkey was working to settle one million people in the cities of Tal Abyad and Ras Al-Ain in northern Syria. This has led to fears of population change.

Russia said it would pledge to remove Turkish forces from a key highway in northern Syria, and replace them with Russian forces to maintain stability. Meanwhile, Turkey began to appoint mayors in several northern Syrian towns.

It was reported that the Russian and Turkish armies had made a deal whereby electricity would be supplied to Tal Abyad by Russia's allies, the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF); while water would be supplied by the Alouk water station that is controlled by Turkish forces. This deal was mainly facilitated by Russian military officials.

It appeared that Turkey was withdrawing all of its forces away from the al-Shirkark silos, which hold important supplies of wheat, this seemed to be a result of Russian mediation.

Russian and Turkish forces are continuing their joint patrols. Questions remained about how much control Turkey has over its proxies, such as the Free Syrian Army.

### Syrian and AANES actions
Some reports stated that Bashar Assad was favorable towards Russia's efforts to restore calm and to stabilize the situation in Syria.

Meanwhile, various Kurdish faction that were historical rivals began to meet in order to work together more. Their stated reason was to stand together against Russia and Turkey more strongly if needed. The Russian government has informed the Kurdish factions that they should reconcile and come up with a unified set of demands to clarify to Russia. Various Kurdish factions blamed each other and their council for lack of progress.

Mustafa Bali, head of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) said there were some agreements on the ground with the Syrian government, for Syrian forces to be deployed along the border. Russian military officials forged agreements between Syria, Turkey and SDF for areas to be patrolled by each side.

The national Syrian government sent representatives to northeast Syria to meet with local groups there in order to address their concerns and to emphasize unity and combined effort to address problems. A meeting occurred in Qamishli city, in northeast Syria, that included Syrian national officials, and delegates from Kurdish, Arab, and Syrian figures and forces. The delegates emphasized their desire to help to protect Syria as a whole.

At a panel discussion on the conflict in December 2019, several experts said the conflict was slowly moving towards resolution. One expert said that the "Astana" diplomatic process, involving Turkey, Russia, and Iran, was having some positive results. Experts also said that Bashar Assad had made progress in restoring rule by local councils in areas affected by the conflict.

Russia said it would pledge to remove Turkish forces from a key highway in northern Syria, and replace them with Russian forces to maintain stability. Meanwhile, Turkey began to appoint mayors in several northern Syrian towns.

On 9 December 2019, various local accounts indicated that Turkey was moving Syrian refugees into its zone of operations in northern Syria for the first time. Erdogan said that Turkey was working to settle one million people in the cities of Tal Abyad and Ras Al-Ain in northern Syria, leading to fears of population changes.

### Diplomacy with NATO member nations
At the NATO summit in London in December 2019, President Emmanuel Macron of France highlighted major differences with Turkey over the definition of terrorism, and said there was little chance this aspect of the conflict could be resolved positively. Macron criticized Turkey strongly for fighting against groups who had been allied with France and the West in fighting terrorism.

Numerous issues in resolving the conflict emerged at the NATO summit in London. Turkey proposed a safe zone where Syrian refugees could be relocated, but this idea did not receive support from all parties. One professed "exclusive" press report claimed that prior to the NATO Summit, there was a meeting at 10 Downing Street of the leaders of France, the UK, Germany and Turkey. One key point that emerged that the Western countries insisted that refugees could only be relocated voluntarily. Meanwhile, there were concerns in NATO about Turkey's growing closeness with Russia.

Erdogan claimed that a four-way summit on Syria was scheduled to occur in Turkey in February 2020, to include Turkey, Germany, the UK and France.

### Diplomacy with nations outside NATO
At a meeting in Damascus, Russian and Syrian officials clearly stated their support for Syria regaining control over all of its territory. The United Arab Emirates also expressed official support for Assad.

A new round of meetings for the Astana summit process took place in the Kazakh capital Nur Sultan. The meeting includes Russia, Syria, Turkey and Iran.
