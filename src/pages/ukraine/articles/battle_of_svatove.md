The **Battle of Svatove** is a current military conflict between Russia and Ukraine over the eastern Ukrainian city of Svatove. The battle began on October 3, 2022, a day after the Ukrainian army recaptured the strategic town of Lyman in Donetsk Oblast.

## Background
During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Svatove fell under occupation by Russian and Luhansk People's Republic forces on 6 March 2022. Following a major counteroffensive by Ukrainian forces in early September 2022, it was reported that Russian forces were leaving the city. By September 14, Russian troops had returned. After Putin declared partial mobilization on 21 September, some of the newly recruited conscripts were sent to Svatove to man the front line after only 2 days of training at most to counter Ukrainian advances.

To counter Ukrainian advances, according to Luhansk Oblast governor Serhiy Haidai, Russian forces mined all roads leading to Svatove and Kreminna, another target Ukrainian forces are attempting to recapture, and on 25 October, Haidai pointed out Russian troops even mined the entire bank of the Krasna River near Svatove.

## Battle
Following the Ukrainian recapture of Lyman on October 2, Ukrainian forces pushed towards the Kharkiv-Luhansk oblast borders. On October 3, they recaptured Borova and the nearby town of Shyikivka. Just south of that, Ukraine recaptured the villages of Izyumske and Druzhelyubivka on the border of Kharkiv and Luhansk oblasts. Ukrainian forces also allegedly advanced towards Chervonopopivka on the Svatove-Kreminna highway, although were pushed back from their positions by October 5.

Between October 4 and 5, Ukrainian forces recaptured Bohuslavka and Borivska Andriivka, north of Borova, Towards the east, Ukrainian forces also captured Hrekivka and Makiivka, two villages in Luhansk Oblast. On October 9, Ukrainian forces recaptured Kruhlyakivka, effectively controlling all settlements along the Oskil River in Kharkiv Oblast.

Between October 9 and 13, Ukrainian forces made small advances into Luhansk Oblast, retaking the villages of Novolyubivka, Nevske, Novoiehorivka, Nadiia, and Andriivka, all southwest of Svatove. In the north, Ukrainian forces recaptured Krokhmalne, securing a section of the Kharkiv-Luhansk oblast border.

By October 24, Ukrainian forces had recaptured Kamazynivka, Myasozharivka, and Nevske in Luhansk Oblast, and Novosadove in Donetsk Oblast. On October 29, Ukrainian forces had established fire control over the Svatove-Kreminna highway, and controlled most villages west of it.

On the night of 2 November, Ukrainian sources claimed to have destroyed an entire Russian battalion near the town of Makiivka, in Svatove Raion. According to a Russian survivor, out of the 570 soldiers in his unit, 29 survived, 12 were wounded, and the rest were killed.

Russia has reportedly conducted counter attacks on November 4th, but unsuccessfully.
