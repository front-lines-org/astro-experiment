**Chernihiv Oblast** (–ß–µ—Ä–Ω—ñÃÅ–≥—ñ–≤—Å—å–∫–∞ –æÃÅ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç—å; also referred to as **Chernihivshchyna**, –ß–µ—Ä–Ω—ñÃÅ–≥—ñ–≤—â–∏–Ω–∞) is an oblast (province) of northern Ukraine. The administrative center of the oblast is the city of Chernihiv. Within the Oblast are 1,511 settlements of various sizes ranging from large cities to very small villages. Population:

## Geography

The total area of the province is around 31,900 km¬≤.

On the west, the oblast is bordered by the Kyiv Reservoir of the Dnieper River and Kyiv Oblast, which has a enclave known as Slavutych, which was created from Chernihiv Oblast for the inhabitants of Chernobyl following the Chernobyl disaster. It is bordered by Sumy Oblast to the east and Poltava Oblast to the south. The northern border of the oblast is part of Ukraine's international border abutting Belarus's Homyel Voblast in the north-west and the Russian Bryansk Oblast in the north-east, respectively.

The oblast is bisected into northern and southern sections by the Desna River, which enters the Dnieper just north of the Kyiv city limits.

## History

Chernihiv Oblast was created as part of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic on 15 October 1932.

The capital city of Chernihiv has known human settlement for over 2,000 years, according to archaeological excavations. Chernihiv Oblast comprises a very important historical region, notable as early as the Kievan Rus' period, when the cities of Chernihiv and Novhorod-Siverskyi were frequently mentioned. The city of Chernihiv was the second most important Ukrainian city during the Rus' period of Ukrainian history, often serving as a major regional capital. Danylo of Chernihiv wrote of his pilgrimage to Jerusalem during this era. The numerous architectural monuments of the city bear witness to the invasions suffered, including those by the Tatars/Mongols, Lithuanians, Poles, Nazis and the Russians. Numerous tragic events have taken place in the region, such as the Battle of Kruty, the Tragedy of Koryukivka, and many others.

During the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Chernihiv Oblast was one of the first regions where Russian and Ukrainian forces clashed. On 4 April 2022 Governor of Chernihiv Oblast Vyacheslav Chaus stated that the Russian military had left Chernihiv Oblast, but that it had planted mines in many areas. On 4 and 5 April 2022 units of the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine retook control of their border crossing in Chernihiv Oblast.

The oblast is located in the historic region of Polesia (–ü–æ–ª—ñ—Å—Å—è, translit. _Polissia_).

Chernihiv also has a brewery producing beer under the name "Chernihivske".

Small minorities of Ukrainian Catholics, Roman Catholics (including the descendants of earlier Polish colonists), and recent converts to Protestantism are also present.

## Culture and tourist attractions

- Antoniyev caverns
- Saviour's Transfiguration Cathedral
- Hustynskyi monastery
- Knyazhyi hrad
  There are a few outstanding historical Orthodox churches and buildings in Chernihiv, Novhorod-Siverskyi, Liubech, Nizhyn (Nezhyn) and Koselets' (a city of Ancient Rus', older than Kyiv). Nizhyn is an historical cossack city and home to a university.

The Chernihiv region was famous for its specific style of folk icon-painting. Brightness and realistic depictions of the saints were typical for it, with red and hot yellow paints used. The icons were decorated by flowers in a manner reminiscent of Slavonic pre-Christian traditions. The icons from the Chernihiv region were spread outside its territory. Many of them are preserved in the Museum of Ukrainian home icons of the Radomysl Castle.

## Nomenclature

Most of Ukraine's oblasts are named after their capital cities, officially referred to as "oblast centers" (–æ–±–ª–∞—Å–Ω–∏–π —Ü–µ–Ω—Ç—Ä, translit. _oblasnyi tsentr_). The name of each oblast is a relative adjective, formed by adding a feminine suffix to the name of respective centre city: _Chernihiv_ is the centre of the _Chernihivs‚Äôka oblast‚Äô_ (Chernihiv Oblast). Most oblasts are also sometimes referred to in a feminine noun form, following the convention of traditional regional place names, ending with the suffix "-shchyna", as is the case with the Chernihiv Oblast, _Chernihivshchyna_.
