An ongoing counteroffensive by the Armed Forces of Ukraine on Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory of Kharkiv Oblast, Donetsk Oblast, and Luhansk Oblast, was launched on 6 September 2022. Following the launch of the Ukrainian southern counteroffensive in Kherson in late August, Ukrainian forces began a second counteroffensive in early September in Kharkiv Oblast, in the east of the country.

By 9 September, the counteroffensive in Kharkiv Oblast led to a breakthrough. By 10 September, the Institute for the Study of War said that Ukrainian forces had captured approximately 2500 sqkm in the Kharkiv region by effectively exploiting the breakthrough, and _Reuters_ reported that Russian forces had been forced to withdraw from their base at Izium after being cut off by the capture of the key railway hub Kupiansk.

On 13 September, Ukrainian forces established a bridgehead over the Oskil River near Borova. On 17 September, Ukrainian forces claimed they had breached the Russian front line along the Oskil River and advanced to the left bank, and by 24–25 September, they established at least 5 such bridgeheads on the east side of Oskil River. On 1 October Ukrainian forces had entered the key city of Lyman.

## Background

Russian offensives in the first months of its invasion of Ukraine left large swathes of the Kharkiv Oblast under Russian control, including the key logistical hubs of Izium and Kupiansk. The majority of Kharkiv Oblast remained within Ukrainian control, however, including the city of Kharkiv, which was subjected to continuous Russian rocket, artillery, and cluster munition bombardment that persisted into August.

Ukrainian forces held off Russian advances towards Kharkiv, then launched counteroffensives in March and May pushing the Russians from the outskirts of the city. By 6 June, the Russian bombardment of Kharkiv had killed 606 civilians and injured 1,248 according to Amnesty International.

The battle lines in the greater Kharkiv Oblast remained largely static over the next few months as Ukrainian and Western military analysts believed Russia lacked the ground forces to renew its offensive. The Kharkiv death toll exceeded 1,000 by August.

## Counteroffensive

### Prelude

After weeks of Ukrainian propaganda about a counteroffensive in southern Ukraine, Russia redeployed thousands of troops, including elite units such as the 1st Guards Tank Army, to Kherson Oblast, leaving its remaining troops manning a "stretched and tired Russian front that spanned some 1,300km — roughly the distance from London to Prague."

The arrival of US-supplied HIMARS guided rocket artillery enabled Ukrainian forces to strike 70 kilometers behind Russian lines, targeting Russian bases and ammunition depots as far back as Kupiansk and Kivsharivka in the weeks preceding the eastern counteroffensive. These strikes further weakened Russian logistics and morale.

On 29 August, Ukraine announced it would soon launch an offensive in the Kherson region of southern Ukraine. Ukrainian units attacked soon after, and Russia's attention shifted to its Kherson line. While the Kherson offensive might be genuine, Western analysts view it as part of a ploy to divert Russian forces away from Kharkiv prior to Ukraine's much larger eastern counteroffensive. In any case, Russian forces in Kharkiv were left understrength and unprepared in the days preceding 6 September.

A referendum to annex Russian-occupied territory was postponed on 5 September 2022 due to security concerns.

### First phase: (6–12 September 2022)

#### Initial advance

On 6 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, taking Russian forces by surprise. In a 10 September interview with the Guardian, Ukrainian special forces spokesman Taras Berezovets stated Russia "thought [the counteroffensive] would be in the south… then, instead of the south, the offensive happened where they least expected, and this caused them to panic and flee."

Ukrainian troops advanced at least 20 km into Russian-held territory and recaptured some 400 sqkm of territory during the first two days.

By 9 September, Ukraine had broken through Russian lines, with the Ukrainian military saying that it had advanced nearly 50 km and recaptured over 1000 sqkm of territory. This advance placed them approximately 44 km northwest of Izium, the main Russian logistics base in the region, a rate of advancement largely unseen since Russia withdrew from Kyiv at the start of the war. The fall of Izium on 10 September was described by _The Washington Post_ as a "stunning rout"; the Institute for the Study of War assessed that Ukrainian forces had captured approximately 2500 sqkm in the breakthrough.

One military expert said that it was the first time since World War II that whole Russian units had been lost in a single battle, leading to comparisons to another historical battle fought at Izium: the 1942 Soviet defeat in the Second Battle of Kharkov, which resulted in over 200,000 Soviet deaths.

#### Breakthrough

![UA flag in liberated Balakliia 01](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Redirect/file/UA_flag_in_liberated_Balakliia_01.png?)
![UA TDF in liberated Shevchenkove](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Redirect/file/UA_TDF_in_liberated_Shevchenkove.jpg?)
On 6 September, having concentrated their forces north of Balakliia at Pryshyb, a small village about 15km northwest of Balakliia, Ukrainian troops launched a counteroffensive in the Kharkiv Oblast, which drove Russian forces back to the left bank of the Donets and Serednya Balakliika rivers. The Ukrainian forces involved are Ukrainian special forces, plus tanks, armoured personnel carriers and troops from the 92nd Mechanised Brigade.

On the same day, Ukrainian forces captured Verbivka, Balakliia Raion, Kharkiv Oblast, about 8km east of Pryshyb and less than 3km northwest of Balakliia. Several Russian sources reported that Russian forces demolished unspecified bridges on the eastern outskirts of Balakliia to prevent further Ukrainian advances.

Ukrainian troops then went on the offensive in the directions of Balakliia, Volokhiv Yar, Shevchenkove, Kupiansk and the districts Savyntsi and Kunye, situated east of Balakliia. According to Russian sources on this line of contact Ukrainians were opposed in some areas of the line by lightly armed forces of the DPR Militia, while Ukrainian sources said that the forces in this region were professional Russian soldiers, not conscripts from the Donbas.

By the following day, Ukrainian forces had advanced some 20 km into Russian-occupied territory, recapturing approximately 400 km2, and reaching positions northeast of Izium. Russian sources claimed this success was likely due to the relocation of Russian forces to Kherson, in response to the Ukrainian offensive there.

By 8 September, Ukrainian troops had advanced 50 km deep into Russian defensive positions north of Izium. SOBR units of Russian National Guard forces lost control of Balakliia, about 44 km northwest of Izium, although Ukraine did not establish control of the city until 10 September. Near the city, Ukrainian forces recaptured the largest ammunition storage base of the Central Rocket and Artillery Directorate of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. Ukrainian forces also regained control over more than 20 settlements. On the same day, Ukrainian media reported that a high-ranking Russian officer had been captured by Ukrainian forces on the Kharkiv front. Based on footage of the man, it was speculated that he was Lieutenant General Andrei Sychevoi, Commander of the Western Military District of the Russian Armed Forces.

On 9 September, the Russian-backed administration ordered the evacuation into Russia of the population from Izium, Kupiansk and Velykyi Burluk. Local residents later reported that at this point Russian soldiers in the area began to flee villages, leaving behind their weaponry, before Ukrainian troops even arrived. Later in the day Ukrainian forces reached Kupiansk, a vital transit hub at the junction of several of the main railway lines supplying Russian troops at the front. The Institute for the Study of War said it believed Kupiansk would likely fall in the next 72 hours. In response to the Ukrainian advance, Russian reserve units were sent as reinforcements to both Kupiansk and Izium.

On 10 September, Kupiansk and Izium were retaken by Ukrainian forces and Ukrainian forces were reportedly advancing towards Lyman. An advisor to the head of Kharkiv regional council, Natalia Popova, posted photos on Facebook of soldiers holding a Ukrainian flag outside Kupiansk city hall. Ukrainian security officials and police moved into the recaptured settlements to check the identities of those who stayed under Russian occupation. Later that day, Luhansk Oblast Governor Serhiy Haidai claimed that Ukrainian soldiers had advanced into the outskirts of Lysychansk, while Ukrainian partisans had reportedly managed to capture parts of Kreminna. Haidai stated Russian forces had fled the city, leaving Kreminna "practically empty".

The _New York Times_ said "the fall of the strategically important city of Izium, in Ukraine's east, is the most devastating blow to Russia since its humiliating retreat from Kyiv.” The Russian Ministry of Defence spokesperson Igor Konashenkov responded to these developments by claiming that Russian forces in the Balakliia and Izium area would "regroup" in the Donetsk area "in order to achieve the stated goals of the special military operation to liberate Donbas". Ukrainian President Zelenskyy said that "The Russian army in these days is demonstrating the best that it can do — showing its back. And, of course, it's a good decision for them to run." He claimed that Ukraine has recaptured 2000 sqkm since the start of the counteroffensive.

On 11 September, _Newsweek_ reported that Ukrainian forces had "penetrated Russian lines to a depth of up to 70 kilometers in some places and retaken more than 3,000 square kilometers of territory since September 6". Reports that Russian troops had withdrawn from Kozacha Lopan and locals had raised the Ukrainian flag next to the town hall came in from objectiv.tv. A map used in the briefing of the Russian Ministry of Defense on the same day confirmed that Russian forces had withdrawn from Kozacha Lopan, as well as Vovchansk and other settlements on the Ukraine-Russia border. Velykyi Burluk was also retaken.

On 28 September, "Financial Times" published an article with many interactive graphics and gave a vivid depiction of the reasons behind Ukrainian's lightning counteroffensive toward Kupiansk, and pointed out HIMARS was one of the reasons enabling Ukraine to overpower Russia in 6 days and span 90 km (roughly the same distance between London and Cambridge in UK) but recover more than 2,500 square kilometers of land.

#### Russian withdrawal from Kharkiv Oblast west of Oskil River

![Liberation of Izium, September 17, 2022](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Redirect/file/Liberation_of_Izium%2C_September_17%2C_2022.png?)
In the afternoon of 11 September, the Russian Ministry of Defense announced the formal pullout of Russian forces from nearly all of Kharkiv Oblast. The ministry "announced that an 'operation to curtail and transfer troops' was underway." At 20:06 that day, Ukrainian critical infrastructure sites (including Kharkiv TEC-5) were hit by Kalibr cruise missiles. The attack left Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Odesa (partially) and Donetsk Oblasts without electricity. Meanwhile, clashes between Ukrainian attackers and Russian defenders continued at Lyman.

On 12 September, according to the summary of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Defense Forces ousted Russian troops from more than 20 settlements: in particular, the Russians left the villages of Velykyi Burluk and Dvorichna in Kharkiv Oblast. The Russian head of the Kharkiv occupation authority, Vitaly Ganchev, told Russian TV (Rossiya-24) that Ukrainian forces outnumbered Russian forces by "8 times". The border with the Russian Belgorod Oblast has been closed after some 5,000 civilians were "evacuated" to Russia.

The entirety of occupied Kharkiv Oblast west of the Oskil River was retaken by Ukraine by 13 September, with state media saying its troops had entered Vovchansk.

#### Other gains

In the morning of 11 September, Ukrainian Governor of Luhansk Oblast, Serhiy Haidai, claimed that Russian forces had mostly left Starobilsk. In the same message, he stated Russian occupational authorities were also leaving cities annexed by Russia in 2014.

On 12 September, Ukrainian forces liberated Sviatohirsk, which Russian forces captured in June 2022, and inched closer to the administrative border between Kharkiv and Donetsk Oblasts as well as Lyman, a strategic railway town in Donetsk Oblast captured by Russian forces in late May 2022 after a fierce battle.

Reports of the Russian military moving out of areas they formerly controlled in Luhansk Oblast began on 12 September alongside a withdrawal from the city of Svatove; > however, Russian troops returned to Svatove on 14 September.

On 12 September, President Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian forces have retaken a total of 6,000 km2 from Russia, in both the south and the east. On 13 September, during his nightly address, he said they have recaptured 8,000 km2 of territory from Russia.

According to Oryx, Russia had lost at least 338 pieces of military hardware in the five days to 11 September. This included fighter jets, tanks and trucks that had been destroyed, damaged or captured.

### Second phase: (since 13 September 2022)

![Fallen Russian soldiers during the retreat from Lyman](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Redirect/file/Fallen_Russian_soldiers_during_the_retreat_from_Lyman.jpg?)

#### Oskil River advance

Despite Russia's intent to keep the front line along Oskil River, Ukrainian forces already crossed the river as early as 13 September at several locations. Around 13 September, Ukrainian forces crossed the river near Borova and established a bridgehead. By 24–25 September, Ukraine established at least five bridgeheads on the left bank of Oskil River.

On 15 September, some Russian sources claimed Ukrainian forces set up artillery positions at Hryanykivka, across from Dvorichna on the east side of Oskil River. On the same day, Ukrainian forces recaptured Sosnove in Donetsk Oblast, and forced Russian forces to withdraw from Studenok, a village in Kharkiv Oblast and southeast to Izium, to avoid encirclement.

On 16 September, Ukrainian forces captured Kupiansk-Vuzlovyi, on the east side of Oskil River and across from Kupiansk, and the eastern portion of Kupiansk, establishing another bridgehead over the Oskil River. This further threatens Russian supply lines in northern Luhansk Oblast, imperiling Russian operations throughout the rest of Donbas.

By 18 September, the Ukrainian military stated that it had crossed over to and controlled the left bank (east side) of the Oskil River.

On 19 September it was confirmed that Ukrainian forces had liberated the village of Bilohorivka. This was a significant gain as the territory is part of Luhansk Oblast, meaning that Russia can no longer claim full control of the region.

On 22 September it was reported that "Ukrainian forces have taken ground east of Dvorichna and are fighting in Tavilzhanka, which is reportedly still contested territory." Given that Tavilzhanka is just east of another settlement, Hrianykivka, and the latter was already liberated by Ukrainian forces on September 15 when Ukraine set up artillery positions there, therefore it is "consistent with previous reporting on continued Ukrainian efforts to penetrate the current Russian defensive lines that run along the Oskil River and push eastward."

On 23 September Ukrainian Armed Forces liberated the village of Yatskivka in Donetsk region according to Oleksii Hromov, deputy head of operations directorate of the general staff of UAF.

On 24 September, Ukrainian forces liberated Horobivka, which is east to Hrianykivka and also on the east side of Oskil River. Also, Ukrainian forces liberated Petropavlivka, 7 km east of Kupiansk, and not far away from Kupiansk-Vuzlovyi, also on the east side of Oskil River. Another two settlements, Kucherivka and Podoly, are sandwiched between Kupiansk-Vuzlovyi and Petropavlivka, and were liberated before 24 September.

On 25 September, Ukrainian forces likely control Maliivka, a settlement north of Kharkiv-Donetsk border and east to Pisky-Radkivskyi, during the Second Battle of Lyman. By 26 September, much of Kupiansk District had been retaken by Ukraine.

On 26 September, Ukrainian forces advanced north from Donetsk Oblast and liberated Pisky-Radkivskyi, a settlement on the east side of Oskil River in Kharkiv Oblast and 35 km northwest of Lyman but directly south to Borova.

On 27 September further incremental gains were reported east of the Oskil river with Ukrainian forces entering the towns of Lidkodub and Korovyi Yar.

On 3 October, it was reported that Russian forces had fled from Nyzhe Zolone, Pidlyman, Nyznya Zhuravka, Borova and Shyikivka in Kharkiv Oblast and Ukrainian authorities had regained control of those settlements. It was also claimed that the Kreminna-Svatove Highway was under Ukrainian control, although the ISW notes that it is still controlled by Russian forces as of 4 October.

#### Encirclement and liberation of Lyman

As a result of the Ukraine's "lightning counteroffensive" throughout September, Russian forces retreated to Lyman, a major city in Donetsk Oblast with critical Russian supply lines. According to the British Ministry of Defense, "Lyman’s operational importance was due to its command over a road crossing over the Siverskyi Donets River, behind which Russia has been attempting to consolidate its defenses." On 26 September, the New York Times reported a standoff between the critical cities of Lyman, held by Russia, and Bakhmut, held by Ukraine. With the approaching winter likely to stall both militaries, Lyman was set to be the battle that decides the eastern theater of the war.

On 28 September, Ukrainian forces entered the town of Novoselivka located in the Donetsk region, about 12 km northwest of Lyman, on the left bank of the Oskil River, and is a strategic crossing point.

On 30 September, Ukrainian forces liberated Yampil, a key village 8 km to the southeast of Lyman. A pro-Russian telegram channel reported "The Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to break through the defensive orders of the RF (Russian Federation) Armed Forces and force the Russian troops to retreat to the city (Lyman)." It was also reported that Ukrainian troops had captured the town of Drobysheve, 10 km to the northwest of Lyman.

On 1 October, Ukrainian troops raised the Ukrainian flag at an entrance to the city of Lyman. It was reported that up to 5,000 Russian troops remained trapped inside. According to Serhii Cherevatyi, spokesperson for Ukraine's eastern forces, the Russian forces were surrounded. Ukrainian forces advanced into the city, and according to the Guardian, Lyman "was a bloody rout." Russian officers had refused invitations to surrender, so Russian troops fled in a disorganized manner. The city was significantly damaged during the Russian occupation, with locals stating only a few hundred remained of the 27,000 who lived in Lyman before the war. Russia confirmed that it had lost control of Lyman later that afternoon. Estimates of casualties during the battle are unclear, however Associated Press reporters noted at least 18 Russian bodies remained on the streets on 3 October.

The gains came a day after Russian president Putin announced annexation of Russian-occupied territories at a ceremony in Moscow, claiming the occupied regions of Ukraine, including the Donbas, were now Russian. Retired US General, Ben Hodges, said "[the recapture of Lyman] puts in bright lights that his claim is illegitimate and cannot be enforced."

On 2 October, Ukrainian troops recaptured Dibrova in the Luhansk Oblast and by 5 October images appeared on social media of Ukrainian troops at the entrance sign to Hrekivka and Makiivka, 20km southwest of Svatove. These were the first villages to be liberated in the Luhansk region.

## Russian torture chambers

After the successful liberation of the region from Russian occupation, Ukrainian authorities discovered torture chambers which had been used by Russian troops during their time in control of the area, including in the villages of Balakliya and Kozacha Lopan. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that more than ten torture chambers, along with mass graves, had been discovered in the Kharkiv areas liberated by Ukrainian troops.

The near-complete silence of the Russian authorities on the defeat – or any explanation for the developments there – generated considerable anger among some pro-war commentators and Russian nationalists on social media. On 11 September, some called for President Vladimir Putin to make immediate changes to ensure final victory in the war, with a number of pro-war bloggers calling for mobilization inside Russia.

The former separatist commander and pro-war military blogger Igor Girkin said that Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu should be executed by firing squad and publicly expressed the opinion that "The war in Ukraine will continue until the complete defeat of Russia. We have already lost; the rest is just a matter of time." He said that full mobilization in Russia was the "last chance" for victory. Pro-Kremlin war journalist Alexander Kots publicly stated that "We need to do something about the system where our leadership doesn't like to talk about bad news, and their subordinates don't want to upset their superiors."

While Ukraine was conducting its counteroffensive, Vladimir Putin opened a Ferris wheel in Moscow's VDNKh and celebrated Moscow City Day. War bloggers criticized him for continuing the celebrations.

On the evening of 10 September, a festive fireworks display took place in Moscow, which was previously called for to be canceled by many pro-war politicians inside Russia, like Sergey Mironov, the leader of A Just Russia — For Truth.

Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov questioned Russian leadership of the war, writing on Telegram: "They have made mistakes and I think they will draw the necessary conclusions. If they don't make changes in the strategy of conducting the special military operation in the next day or two, I will be forced to contact the leadership of the Defense Ministry and the leadership of the country to explain the real situation on the ground."

On 12 September, _Meduza_ reported that, per two sources close to the Kremlin, the proposed referendums for the annexation of the self-proclaimed Luhansk and Donetsk People's Republics had been postponed indefinitely, following earlier postponement from 11 September to 4 November.

On the same day, Mikhail Sheremet, a State Duma deputy from United Russia, advocated "full mobilization". On 13 September, the leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Gennady Zyuganov spoke for the maximum mobilization of forces and resources, but later the Press Secretary of the CPRF Alexander Yushchenko said that Zyuganov called for the mobilization of the economy and resources, and not the population, and recommended to "execute some groups that engage in outright provocations".

Subsequent Russian attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure were interpreted as an attempt to at least partially satisfy demands of radical war supporters in Russia who called for further escalation of Russian tactics.

On 20 September, the State Duma introduced amendments to the Penal Code, introducing terms "mobilization", "martial law" and inserting Articles "Marauding" and "Surrendering voluntarily". On 20 September, pro-Kremlin administrations in different Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine announced there would be "referendums" on merging these territories with Russia. Analysts consider that one of the aims of such a formal annexation of the territories is to give Putin a pretext of "defending Russian territory" if he needs to order a mobilization of Russia's conscripts.

On 21 September, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation. On 26 September, the British Ministry of Defense said that many new conscripts are already being deployed in Ukraine without any training or proper equipment.

### Worldwide

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) noted that the rapid pace of the Ukrainian counteroffensive was disrupting the long-held Russian army lines of land communication used to support the Russian army in the northern part of the Luhansk region. According to ISW, this would lead to a serious hindrance to Russia's operations. As of 11 September, ISW noted that Western weapons were necessary for the success of Ukraine, but not enough, and skillful planning and execution of the campaign played a decisive role in the lightning success. ISW contended that long preparations and the announcement of a counter-offensive in the Kherson region had confused the Russians, leading to a diversion of the Russian army's attention away from the Kharkiv region, where the Ukrainian army subsequently struck.

On 10 September, representatives of the British Ministry of Defence suggested that the Russian army practically had not defended most of the territories recaptured by Ukraine.

Reuters and the BBC called the loss of Izium, which the Russian army had been trying to occupy for over a month at the start of the invasion, a "great humiliation" for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Moscow's worst defeat since the retreat from Kyiv in March. _Financial Times_ ran an article on 28 September depicting the counteroffensive as "[the] 90km journey that changed the course of the war in Ukraine." According to ISW, the liberation of Izium, occupied in early April, destroyed Russia's prospect of seizing the Donetsk Oblast.

According to Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba, Ukraine's counteroffensives proved that the Ukrainian military could end the war faster with more Western weapons, a statement echoed by President Zelenskyy on 12 September. Ukraine's successes in Kharkiv Oblast were a crucial confidence boost for a Kyiv that increasingly relied on its Western allies for military aid.

## Aftermath

As Ukrainian forces entered the towns of Balakliia and Izium, they found numerous places where Ukrainian civilians were held prisoner, tortured and executed by Russian occupation forces. Seven Sri Lankan students were also abducted and tortured by Russian forces. The death toll among civilians as result of the initial Russian siege and subsequent occupation was initially estimated at 1,000 residents. After the expulsion of Russian forces, witnesses described residents being detained, abducted, tortured and executed by Russians during the occupation; a number of burial sites were found.

Exhumation of the bodies from mass graves buried in Pishanske cemetery in Izium started on 15 September, most of them were described as civilians. Some bodies of civilians and soldiers had traces of torture, hands tied and rope around their necks, suggesting they were not killed in battle or bombing, but executed as prisoners. Russian diplomats dismissed the claims as "provocation" but satellite images published by Maxar confirmed presence of the graves before the Ukrainian counteroffensive. In total, ten torture and execution sites were located in the town of Izium.

On 15 September President Zelenskyy visited the liberated city of Izium and decorated soldiers who had participated in the operation. In his daily address he named units that had participated: the 14th and 92nd Separate Mechanized Brigades, 25th Separate Airborne Brigade, 80th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade, 107th MLRS Brigade, the 40th, 43rd, 44th Separate Artillery Brigades, 26th Artillery Brigade, 15th Separate Artillery Reconnaissance Brigade, and Main Intelligence Directorate.

The counteroffensives in Kherson and Kharkiv had the effect of disrupting and advancing the 2022 annexation referendums in Russian-occupied Ukraine from November to late September. The Russian defeat elicited an outcry among state-funded media in Russia with one pro-Kremlin tabloid blaming "supply and manpower shortages, poor coordination, and tactical mistakes orchestrated by military officials".
