  Before July 2020, Mykolaiv Oblast was subdivided into 24 regions: 19 *raion*s (administrative districts) and 5 city municipalities (_mis'krada_ or _misto_), officially known as _territories governed by city councils_ which are directly subordinate to the oblast government.

Note: Asterisks (\*) Though the administrative center of the rayon is housed in the city/town that it is named after, cities do not answer to the rayon authorities only towns do; instead they are directly subordinated to the oblast government and therefore are not counted as part of rayon statistics.

At a lower level of administration, these district-level administrations are subdivided into:

The local administration of the oblast is controlled by the Mykolaiv Oblast Rada. The governor of the oblast is the Mykolaiv Oblast Rada speaker, appointed by the President of Ukraine.
