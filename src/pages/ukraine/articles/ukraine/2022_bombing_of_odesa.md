During the southern Ukraine offensive of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the city of Odesa and the surrounding region have been the target of shelling and air strikes by Russian forces on multiple occasions since the conflict began, fired predominantly from Russian warships situated offshore in the Black Sea. The city has also been targeted by Russian cruise missiles.

The first Russian airstrikes against Odesa occurred on the first day of the invasion, early on 24 February, targeting warehouses in the city as well as radar and air defense systems in Lipetske. The attacks left at least 22 killed and 6 wounded among servicemen and soldiers. Ukrainian authorities also reported that Russian shelling targeted the military airport in Odesa and destroyed one aircraft. Russian saboteurs had begun operating in Odesa by 27 February, as Ukrainian authorities detained them and confiscated their equipment. Evacuation trains began taking civilians out of the city towards Chernivtsi and Uzhhorod on 2 March, with further evacuation trains operating on 8 March.

At around 12:00 local time on 2 March, Russian forces shelled the village of Dachne to the north-west of Odesa, damaging a natural gas pipeline and setting fire to nine houses and a garage. This was followed on 3 March by the shelling of the nearby villages of Zatoka and Bilenke, killing at least one civilian in the latter village. Russian warships also shelled the Ukrainian civilian vessel _Helt_ in the port of Odesa, causing it to sink.

On 5 March, one Russian Mil Mi-8 of registration number _RF-91165_ was destroyed near Odesa. A new brigade of the Territorial Defense Forces of Ukraine was founded in Odesa on 8 March, after initial complaints by civilians in the city wishing to join the defence force of a lack of organisation as they were sent home without weapons.

Russian attacks in Odesa intensified towards the end of March. During the morning of 21 March, Russian warships reappeared offshore and began shelling targets in Odesa including the port, before Ukrainian coastal artillery returned fire and drove them back out into the Black Sea. On 25 March, Ukrainian air defences claimed to shot down three cruise missiles over the Black Sea which were on course to strike targets in and around Odesa. Ukraine claimed two more Russian cruise missiles were shot down off the coast of Odesa on 27 March, although the city subsequently came under heavy mortar fire according to a statement on Telegram by Serhii Bratchuk, spokesman for the Odesa military administration.

On 13 April, Ukrainian presidential adviser Oleksiy Arestovych and Odesa governor Maksym Marchenko said that the Russian cruiser Moskva, flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, had been hit by two Neptune anti-ship missiles and was on fire in rough seas. The missiles were apparently launched in or near Odesa at _Moskva_ located 60 to 65 nautical miles offshore. The Russian Ministry of Defence said that a fire had caused munitions to explode, and that the ship had been seriously damaged and the crew fully evacuated, without any reference to a Ukrainian strike. The following day, the ship sunk as it was attempting to reach port for repairs. Russia stated one sailor from the _Moskva_ was killed and 27 were missing, while 396 crewmembers were rescued.

On 23 April, a Russian missile strike hit a military facility and two residential buildings, killing eight civilians and wounding 18 or 20, according to Ukraine. Russia confirmed the attack stating the facility targeted was a logistic terminal at a military airfield that housed US and European weapons given to Ukraine.

On 27 April, Russian forces attacked and destroyed the Zatoka bridge with the aim of disconnect the city of Odesa with the rest of the country at the east of Dniester river.

On 1 May, Ukrainian President Zelensky said that Russian forces destroyed the newly built runway of the Odesa Airport. Ukrainian officials said Russian forces used a Bastion missile for the attack. The city was bombed again on 7 May, with four missiles hitting a civilian building and another two on the city airport.

On May 9, Russia fired three Kinzhal missiles to Odesa Oblast. At that time, President of the European Council Charles Michel and Prime Minister of Ukraine Denys Shmyhal were in Odesa and had to hide in a bomb shelter. In the evening of the same day, Russian troops fired rockets at three warehouses in Odesa and a shopping centre in the village of Fontanka near the city. One person was killed, and two people were injured in the warehouses, and three people were injured in the mall.

In the night between 30 June and 1 July, three Kh-22 missiles fired from Tu-22M strategic bombers were fired into a 9-store apartment building and an recreational center in the settlement Serhiivka, Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi Raion, Odesa Oblast. The whole section of the apartment building was destroyed. At least 21 people were killed and more than 38 wounded.

On 23 July, less than a day after signing a grain export deal with Ukraine, Russia launched Kalibr missiles at the Odesa sea trade port. According to Ukraine, two of the four missiles were intercepted. Russian officials told Turkey that Russia had "nothing to do" with the missile strike. The next day, Igor Konashenkov, a spokesman of the Russian Ministry of Defence, confirmed the strike, claiming that it destroyed a Ukrainian warship and a warehouse of Harpoon anti-ship missiles.

As of July 26, 2022, as a result of rocket attacks in Odesa, 11 civilians were killed: eight people (including a three-month-old girl) - as a result of an attack on the residential complex "Tiras" on April 23; 1 teenager during the attack on the dormitory on May 2, 1 employee of the warehouse during the attack on the Suvorovsky district of Odessa on May 9 and a warehouse guard on June 20.
