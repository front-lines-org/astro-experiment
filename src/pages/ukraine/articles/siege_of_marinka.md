The **siege of Marinka**  is an ongoing siege taking place in the city of Marinka between the Armed Forces of Russia and Donbas separatist forces and the Armed Forces of Ukraine. The town of Marinka, Ukraine is located in the Donbas region. The fighting began after Russian President Vladimir Putin's recognition of the Donetsk People's Republic and the subsequent Russian invasion of Ukraine. Three weeks later, Russia and DNR forces launched an offensive on Marinka.

In June 2015, Marinka had been the site of a one-day battle near Marinka, the first serious conflict after the February signing of Minsk II, resulting in the failure of the DNR Offensive, in which Ukrainian forces continued to hold Marinka.

## Battle
On March 17, 2022, the Russian Ministry of Defense claimed that DPR forces had captured Marinka. On March 30 and 31, Ukrainian emergency services extinguished "dozens of fires" that they claimed had started in the town because of white phosphorus munitions from Russian forces. On April 17, two people were killed and four were injured after Russian forces shelled the city. Two days later on April 19, Ukrainian forces regained full control of Marinka. Ukrainian forces repelled a Russian attack on the town on April 26.

The ISW reported on May 20 that Russian and DPR forces focused their efforts towards Marinka following the end of the siege of Mariupol. The Russian Ministry of Defence claimed on July 3 that Ukraine's 54th Mechanized Brigade has lost "more than 60% of its personnel and equipment" during clashes in Marinka. On August 5, DPR and Wagner forces claimed to control half of Marinka. Ukraine claimed the next day that Marinka was under siege.

Fighting around Marinka, according to ISW reports, largely stagnated in September.
