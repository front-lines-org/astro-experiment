The **battle of Soledar** is a series of military engagements near the city of Soledar between the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation during the battle for Donbas in 2022.

## Background

During the Eastern Ukraine offensive in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian and pro-separatist forces set their sights on seizing the Donbas region, consisting of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Parts of these oblasts, including their capitals with the same names, were seized in pro-Russian uprisings in 2014. In late June and early July 2022, Luhansk oblast fell under Russian control following the Ukrainian withdrawal from Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk. The battlefield then shifted towards the cities of Bakhmut, Siversk, and Soledar, all key towns in Donetsk Oblast.

The first shelling in Soledar began on 17 May, when Russian forces used drones and planes against Soledar, Klinove, and Vovchoiarivka. The next day, Donetsk Oblast governor Pavlo Kyrylenko said Russian forces had closed within 20 kilometers of Soledar, while shelling the town along with Bakhmut and Kostiantynivka. The Russian Ministry of Defense claimed Ukrainian ammunition warehouses were destroyed in Soledar during these campaigns. On 20 May, a Russian missile had hit and damaged Artemsil saltworks. By the end of May, Russian forces had only advanced 4 kilometers towards Soledar.

On 1 June, Russian shelling killed one person and wounded two others. Shelling continued on 6 June. On 16 June, Russian forces attempted to advance towards Soledar, although failed. Fighting intensified in early July after the fall of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk, with Russian forces shelling Soledar, Bakhmut, and nearby towns on 3 July, along with advancing multiple kilometers. Through the rest of July, shelling and small Russian advances continued. The Vuhlehirska power plant was captured on 26 July, effectively making Soledar the next key target for offensives.

## Battle

On 3 August, the Ukrainian army announced that Russian forces had begun an offensive against the city of Soledar. Russian forces began shelling Soledar, Bakhmut, and surrounding villages to the south and east of the towns. Pro-Russian media claimed that the renewed offensive had breached lines to the east and southeast, although these claims were denied by Ukrainian officials. Later that week, Russian and separatist forces had taken partial to full control of the Knauf gypsum factory southeast of the city center. On 10 August, Russian forces also advanced in the Bilokamyanskyi refractory plant in Soledar. The separatists said they had entered Soledar proper on 11 August, but the Ukrainians did not confirm this. The fighting in Soledar was described in the media as "grueling" and typified by artillery duels between troops entrenched around strategic points, located near hedgerows and tree lines along swathes of farmland; civilians fled to underground shelters to avoid bombardment.

On 16 August, airstrikes and ground engagements continued around Soledar, and the LPR separatists claimed to have controlled most of the city's industrial zone, but there was no evidence they had advanced beyond the gypsum factory. On 19 August, shelling and clashes between the Ukrainian defenders and elements of the LPR forces continued on the eastern outskirts of the city, as the Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian troops were attacking from the Stryapivka and Volodymyrivka directions.

The Ukrainian General Staff reported it repelled Russian assaults near Soledar on 27 August. Clashes near the gypsum plant continued by 31 August. On 8 September, Ukraine said it repelled another Russian assault in Soledar, while Russian sources claimed that Russian and DPR forces had advanced into Soledar's residential areas and were clashing with Ukrainian defenders.

## Analysis

The Institute for the Study of War (ISW), a U.S.-based think tank that has monitored the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, assessed on 8 August 2022 that Russian forces were likely seeking to envelop Bakhmut by capturing Soledar, located north of the city, and Zaitseve, south of Bakhmut. The Russians wanted to set conditions to disrupt Ukrainian control over the T0513 trunk road that supports Ukrainian frontline positions in northeast Donetsk Oblast, the ISW continued.
