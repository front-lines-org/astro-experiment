The **Russian withdrawal from Kherson** and subsequent **Liberation of Kherson** refer to the withdrawal of Russian military forces from the city of Kherson and other areas on the western bank of the Dnieper river that took place from 9 to 11 November 2022. The areas were in the Kherson Oblast and parts of Mykolaiv Oblast. The withdrawal of Russian forces and subsequent liberation of the city by the Armed Forces of Ukraine (ZSU) were a result of the 2022 Ukrainian southern counteroffensive.

## Background
After the 24 February invasion of Ukraine, Russian forces surrounded the city of Kherson in late February, and occupied it about 2 March, 2022, after heavy fighting the previous day.

In September 2022, Russia announced the annexation of the oblast, along with three others in a widely condemned move.

On 9 November, Russian general Sergey Surovikin announced the withdrawal of troops from Kherson and the north bank of the Dnieper. He claimed the reasoning for this decision was that Kherson and nearby settlements couldn't be properly supplied and that civilians were in danger from Ukrainian shelling.

## Withdrawal and liberation


### Ukrainian Armed Forces advancing
On 10 November, a video emerged appearing to show the Ukrainian flag flying in Snihurivka. Ukrainian forces also had regained control of the village of Kyselivka, fifteen kilometers northwest of Kherson. On the same day, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valerii Zaluzhnyi stated that Ukrainian forces had taken back 41 settlements near Kherson since 1 October.

Ukrainian officials estimated half of the Russian soldiers had been withdrawn across the Dnipro by the evening of 10 November. In the early morning of 11 November, Russian infantrymen were seen walking across a pontoon bridge to the eastern shore. Ukrainian armour and columns closed in on Kherson proper as they moved past several towns, villages and suburbs, where they were greeted by cheering and flag-waving civilians.

### Russian withdrawal efforts
As Russian troops retreated across the river Dnipro, Ukrainian troops went further into Kherson Oblast and surrounding areas. The Russian Ministry of Defence claimed on 11 November 5 a.m. Moscow time (2 a.m. UTC) that all soldiers (approximately 30,000) and all military equipment had been successfully moved across the river in an orderly withdrawal. Several analysts and experts considered perfectly conducting such a large and complex manoeuvre in a matter of three days to be logistically impossible. Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov told Reuters: 'It's not that easy to withdraw these troops from Kherson in one day or two days. As a minimum, [it will take] one week' to move them all (40,000 by his estimate).

On Russian social media, many troops appeared to be in panic as they sought to escape, with pro-Kremlin bloggers echoing panic, suggesting a collapse in morale and logistics. Many reports from journalists, Ukrainian civilians and authorities as well as individual Russian soldiers indicated that the withdrawal had been rather chaotic, with many Russian servicemen and materiel left behind on the right bank. DW reported that major equipment pieces such as anti-aircraft defence systems appeared to have been successfully transferred to the other bank, but this would leave troops stuck on the northern side vulnerable to Ukrainian artillery and drone attacks. Groups of Russian soldiers (some of them wounded) were reportedly captured, or voluntarily surrendered to advancing Ukrainian forces. Ukrainian official Serhiy Khlan stated that some Russian soldiers failed to leave Kherson, and changed into civilian clothing. One unidentified Russian soldier appeared to confirm that the last order his unit received was 'to change into civilian clothing and fuck off any way you want'. Some Russian soldiers reportedly drowned while trying to swim across the Dnipro. Ukrainian intelligence posted a Russian-language statement on social media, calling on remaining Russian soldiers to surrender. Footage on social media suggested that Ukrainian troops had captured several Russian tanks, armoured vehicles and crates of ammunition, contradicting the Russian Defence Ministry's statement that '[n]ot a single piece of military equipment or weaponry was left behind on the right [west] bank'.

### Ukrainian Armed Forces entering Kherson

The Armed Forces of Ukraine entered the city on 11 November. Later that day, Ukrainian forces liberated Kherson and the rest of the right bank of Kherson Oblast. There were some fears that Russian forces might have laid a trap, therefore the ZSU advanced with some caution. As in other liberated areas, the arriving Ukrainians found mines and booby traps, which posed a danger to both soldiers and civilians. On 11 November, the Ukrainian military was working to clear them, but several people were wounded by such devices, and at least one was killed. As the ZSU moved into the city, no ambushes of any sort appeared to have been prepared, with some observers describing the disorderly retreat as a "rout".

When Ukrainian troops arrived, crowds of civilians gathered to welcome them, and celebrated the liberation. On Freedom Square (Площа Свободи), civilians were seen chanting "Glory to the ZSU [Ukraine’s armed forces]", hugging soldiers, singing songs and waving Ukrainian flags. One female soldier of the ZSU was lifted up by two men on their shoulders, and then tossed into the air to express their gratitude. Cars took to the streets honking their horns, while residents tore down pro-Russian propaganda posters. Similarly in Bilozerka, a town on the western edge of Kherson city, residents tore down propaganda billboards with a young girl holding a Russian flag, which read: "Russia is here forever". Kherson residents were seen dancing in the darkness around a bonfire singing "Chervona Kalyna", a Ukrainian patriotic song that had been banned by Russian occupation authorities for nine months. Following liberation, Ukrainian president Volodomyr Zelenskyy called it a "historic day".

## Aftermath


### Military and political impact
By withdrawing, Russian forces ceded control of about 40% of Kherson Oblast to Ukraine. The loss of Kherson has been widely regarded as a significant blow to Vladimir Putin, who on 30 September said that Kherson would be "part of Russia forever". On 12 November, the occupying forces declared Henichesk, a port city on the Sea of Azov, to be the "temporary administrative capital of the Kherson region". During the withdrawal, Russian soldiers took the bones of the 18th century Prince Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin, who was considered the modern founder of the city, from Kherson's St. Catherine's Cathedral.

Initially, most of the city's inhabitants were euphoric, celebrating the Russian withdrawal in public, and welcoming the Ukrainian forces as liberators, while others were worried about the time ahead. A Kherson resident said: 'I want to celebrate, but something tells me it is not over yet. The Russians can't be giving up so easily, not after everything that has happened. I am scared for the winter and worry the city will become a battle ground. We will be in the firing line.' Military analysts stated that there was a danger of Russian artillery shelling Kherson from the eastern bank of the Dnipro.

On 14 November Zelenskyy made an unannounced visit to Kherson and spoke to a crowd of several hundred residents, saying "We are, step by step, coming to all of our country...I am happy we are in Kherson.” The NOS described the situation on the ground as "a sort of unspoken ceasefire. That both belligerents have taken a kind of break, and are not extensively shooting at each other." Aleksandr Dugin, the ideologue of Russian nationalism and Eurasianism, openly criticized Vladimir Putin for failing to defend "Russian cities" such as Kherson.

### Damage to infrastructure and logistics
Satellite images from Maxar Technologies showed that major damage to infrastucture had been done during the withdrawal from Kherson, including the destruction of at least seven bridges, four of them across the river Dnipro, within 24 hours. Two spans of the Antonivka Road Bridge were destroyed; according a reporter from the pro-Russian newspaper *Komsomolskaya Pravda* at the scene, '[t]hey were likely blown up during the withdrawal of the Russian group of forces from the right bank to the left'. Upstream, the Kakhovka Dam was also damaged; as of 11 November, Ukrainian forces were still not in control of the dam, although they had retaken the village of Tyahynka, located 20 kilometres to the west.

Much of Kherson city's electricity, internet and water supply networks had broken down by the time Ukraine re-established control. President Zelenskyy said on 12 November: "Before fleeing from Kherson, the occupiers destroyed all the critical infrastructure: communications, water, heat, electricity."

The occupied Kherson region is home to part of the North Crimean Canal, which, prior to Russia's annexation of Crimea, provided 85% of Crimea's drinking and agriculture water. Ukraine shut down the canal in 2014 soon after Russia annexed Crimea. Russia restored the flow of water in March 2022. Regaining control of Kherson means Ukraine could once again cut off water to Crimea.

### Demining operations
Governor of Mykolaiv Oblast Vitalii Kim warned that there were still 'a lot of mines in the liberated territories and settlements. Don't go there for no reason. There are casualties.' Yaroslav Yanushevich, Kherson Oblast military chair, stated that efforts were made to return the city to 'normal life', with police urging internally displaced people 'not to rush to return home until stabilisation measures are completed', such as demining operations.

The Ukrainian Deminers Association NGO told *The Guardian*: "We can't make forecasts yet, as the clearing procedure has only started, but potentially the region of Kherson could be most mined region in the country and unfortunately Ukraine could soon rank first in the world for number of casualties caused by mines." The removal of mines and tripwires across the oblast and the rest of the recaptured territories of Ukraine was expected to take months if not years.

## Reactions
 * 🇷🇺 Russia reiterated that Kherson Oblast was a federal subject of Russia.
 * 🇺🇸 US President Joe Biden said that the decision to withdraw shows that Russia's military has "real problems."
 * Secretary General of NATO Jens Stoltenberg reiterated support for Ukraine and that if Russia withdrew, it would "be another victory for Ukraine."
 * 🇹🇷 President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan said that Russia's withdrawal from Kherson was "positive and important" and that he would continue diplomacy with Russia.
