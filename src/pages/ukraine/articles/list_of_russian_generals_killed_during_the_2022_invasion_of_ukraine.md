During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, a high number of Russian generals have been killed in action. As of 11 July 2022, Ukrainian sources claimed that 14 Russian generals had been killed during the invasion. Although some claims were rebutted, the loss of even two general officers is rare. The scale of these losses is unprecedented since World War II. This has been attributed to Russian senior commanders going to the field to address "difficulties in command and control" and "faltering Russian performance on the front line", insecure communication by Russian forces, and United States military intelligence that allowed the Ukrainians to target Russian officers.

## Analysis

![Major General Roman Kutuzov gives a speech in Chita (2019-01-13)](<https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Redirect/file/Major_General_Roman_Kutuzov_gives_a_speech_in_Chita_(2019-01-13).jpg?>)

Analysts at the Jerusalem Institute for Security and Strategy and the French Institute of International Relations find that the number of Russian generals killed during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine suggests that the poor morale among Russian forces and a slow advance into Ukraine forced high-ranking officers to put themselves at risk in an effort to achieve military objectives. UK intelligence attributed the deaths of senior commanders to their going to the field to personally lead operations to address "difficulties in command and control" and "faltering Russian performance on the front line." Western governments say at least 10 Russian generals have been killed, which they attribute to major strategic errors.

In addition to these flag officers, senior officers have been killed by Ukrainian forces; on 23 March, Ukrainian official Mykhailo Podoliak stated that their forces had killed "dozens of colonels and other officers". That day, _The Times_ counted five Russian colonels killed in Ukraine so far. On 11 May, MSN reported a total of 42 colonels allegedly killed. By the end of April, at least 317 Russian officers had been killed, a third of them majors, lieutenant colonels, and colonels. A Ukrainian official told _The_ _Wall Street Journal_ that a unit of Ukrainian military intelligence was collecting information of the positions of Russian officers, including generals, artillery commanders, and pilots. High-ranking casualties in the Russian navy include captain 1st rank Andrei Paliy, the deputy commander of the Black Sea Fleet. Anton Kurpin, the commander of the Russian cruiser _Moskva_, has also been reported as killed, although the Russians have not confirmed this.

The Russian military is top-heavy, with generals playing a larger role in day-to-day operations than in other militaries. Russian battalion commanders were given more authority only three years before the invasion. According to analysts and Western officials, Russia had deployed approximately 20 general officers to Ukraine. Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, described the number of Russian generals killed as "a shocking number", while David Petraeus, the former director of the CIA, remarked that it is "very uncommon" for so many generals to be killed and that the Ukrainian military was "picking them off left and right". _The Washington Post_ stated that generals were "killed at a rate not seen since World War II".

The deaths of Russian officers on the front line have been attributed to a number of Russian vulnerabilities in Ukraine, including the use of unsecured communications and the movement of officers to the front line to boost flagging morale and address discipline issues, such as looting. The use of unsecured phones has been attributed to the failure of Russia's secure telephone technology system, Era. In March 2022, two American military officials told _The_ _New York Times_ that Russian generals in Ukraine frequently had conversations on unsecured phones and radios, and that in at least one instance, a general and his staff were killed after the Ukrainians intercepted a call, geolocated it, and attacked the location. _The New York Times_ also reported that U.S. intelligence has provided real-time intelligence to help the Ukrainian military target Russian generals.
