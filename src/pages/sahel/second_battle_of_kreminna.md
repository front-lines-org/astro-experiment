The **Second Battle of Kreminna** is an ongoing military engagement between Russia and Ukraine over the Eastern Ukrainian city of Kreminna. The battle began on 2 October 2022, a day after the Ukrainian Army recaptured the nearby city of Lyman.

## Background
Kreminna was the first city to fall during the Donbas Offensive that was announced by Russia on 18 April.

## Battle
On the night of 27â€“28 September, Ukrainian forces crossed the Siverskyi Donets River in Dronivka, stormed the Siverskyi Donets Forest Park, and successfully blocked the critical Kreminna-Torske road.

On 2 October, Ukrainian forces heavily bombarded Russian positions in Kreminna, and at the same time it advanced as far as the P-66 highway that connects Kreminna and Svatove and were attacking from the north, as well as the west. The next day, Ukrainian troops reportedly advanced to a segment of highway near Chervonopopivka and Pishchane, both in Luhansk Oblast and along the Svatove-Kreminna road within 5km north of Kreminna. Russian sources discussed these Ukrainian advances with great concern and suggested that Ukrainian troops will likely move towards the Luhansk Oblast border and attack Kreminna, 30km east of Lyman. Russian troops, including elements of the BARS-13 detachment and the 20th Combined Arms Army, withdrew from the Lyman area and re-established themselves in Kreminna, where Russian sources claimed the new frontline lied.

To counter Ukrainian advances, Russian forces are said to mine all roads leading to Kreminna and Svatove, another target Ukrainian forces attempt to recapture. According to the ISW, "The Ukrainian General Staff reported that Ukrainian forces suppressed Russian attacks on Bilohorivka and Zolotarivka, both just over 10km west of Lysychansk." , which itself implies that Zolotarivka was liberated some time between 10 September and 21 October, since Ukraine recaptured Bilohorvika on 10 September and formally announced its liberation on 19 September and back then it claimed it advanced onto Zolotarivka and another settlement.

By 29 October, Ukraine not only consolidated gains and continued counteroffensive operations along the Svatove-Kreminna line, but also established full fire control of the critical R-66 highway between Kreminna and Svatove, and fierce battles already ongoing around Chervonopopivka, 6km northwest of Kreminna, for days between Ukrainian and Russian forces.
