The **2022 Deliatyn attack** was a missile attack on an underground weapons depot in Deliatyn, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. It was the first claimed use by Russia of the Kh-47M2 Kinzhal, a hypersonic weapon, against Ukraine.

## History
On March 19, the Russian Defense Ministry said that the Russian military had used hypersonic missiles from the Dagger complex to destroy underground troops in Deliatyn, Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast. Spokesman for the Air Force Command of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Yurii Ihnat confirmed a missile strike in Deliatyn. The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine confirmed the attack on the warehouses, but could not establish the exact type of weapons with which it was inflicted. In addition, according to the ministry: "Unfortunately, Ukraine has become a testing ground for the entire arsenal of Russia's missile weapons. They use Iskander operational and tactical complexes, Caliber cruise missiles and others: Kh-101, Kh-55, X-555.

US officials confirmed to CNN that Russia launched powerful hypersonic missiles against Ukraine last week, the first known use of such missiles in combat. Russia claimed it deployed hypersonic missiles on Friday to destroy an ammunition warehouse in Deliatyn. The launches were likely intended to test the weapons and send a message to the West about Russian capabilities.

### Russian video
Russia posted a video of what it said was its missile strike on the arms depot in Deliatyn, a village in south-western Ukraine only 100 km from the border with Romania. On March 19 evening, *The War Zone* received satellite images taken by the American company Planet Labs, which confirm that the video of the Russian Ministry of Defense shows a strike not on a large warehouse in western Ukraine, but on a farm or large chicken coop in southeastern Kharkiv Oblast. The pictures were taken on March 12, 2022, a week before the video was published and information about the use of the Dagger was spread. By that time, the farm had already been partially destroyed.
