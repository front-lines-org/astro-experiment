The **Battle of Kupiansk** was the third battle of the Ukrainian Kharkiv counteroffensive that began on September 8, 2022 and ended on September 16, 2022. A *Financial Times* article on 28 September depicted the battle as "The 90km journey that changed the course of the war in Ukraine."

## Background
Kupiansk was occupied by Russian forces from 27 February 2022 to 10 September 2022. Although the Ukrainian army had destroyed a railway bridge to slow the Russian advance three days earlier, Kupiansk Mayor Hennadiy Matsehora, member of the Opposition Platform ‚Äî For Life party, surrendered the city to the Russian Army in exchange for a cessation of hostilities, as the Russians threatened to take the city by force. As a result, the Ukrainian government indicted Matsehora for treason the next day. On 28 February 2022, Matsehora was arrested by Ukrainian authorities. Later Kupiansk became the *de facto* seat of Russian-backed Kharkiv military-civilian administration.

## Battle
On 8 September 2022, a representative of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Ukraine announced that Ukrainian forces had retaken more than 20 settlements in the Kharkiv Oblast and "in some areas penetrated Russian defence positions up to 50km". On the same day, the Russian occupation authorities claimed that "the Russian army began to defend the city" and that "additional reinforcements entered the region from Russia", indicating that Ukrainian forces were re-approaching the city from the west, after retaking the town of Shevchenkove earlier that day. On 9 September 2022, Ukrainian forces re-entered the outskirts of Kupiansk, starting the Battle of Kupiansk. By the morning of 10 September 2022, Ukrainian forces had recaptured the city council building. Later that day, a Ukrainian official confirmed that the Ukrainian Armed Forces had liberated the city. The Russian side denied Ukraine's claims and announced to the public that they had evacuated their forces to the eastern bank of the Oskil River. On September 10, 2022, Ukrainian troops entered the eastern part of the city. From an operational point of view, the battle for the city was of decisive importance in the next two days, as the supply of Russian troops went under Izhy via the Kupiansk-Uzlovoi railway station. On September 12, the Ukrainian flag was raised over the city. On the same day, Russian troops left the city. On 16 September, Ukrainian forces captured Kupiansk-Vuzlovyi, on the east side of Oskil River and across from Kupiansk, and the Eastern portion of Kupiansk, establishing another bridgehead over the Oskil River. This further threatens Russian supply lines in Northern Luhansk Oblast, imperiling Russian operations throughout the rest of Donbas.
