A series of large explosions occurred at the Saky airbase in the city of Novofedorivka, Crimea, on August 9, 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The military base had been seized by Russian forces during the 2014 annexation of Crimea, part of the Russo-Ukrainian War.

## Causes
Russian authorities declared a state of emergency and yellow-alert level of terrorist threat, but claimed the explosions were the result of an accident, and said one person was killed, over a dozen injured, and 252 residents moved to temporary shelter due to damage to apartment blocks. Ukrainian authorities initially did not take responsibility for an attack, but stated that nine Russian planes had been destroyed in the preceding day, and unverified social media footage showed at least one destroyed jet fighter at an airbase. A senior Ukrainian military official anonymously stated that special forces and partisans were responsible. Satellite images revealed significant damage with at least eight aircraft, including Su-24 and Su-30 destroyed on the apron.

Former military operatives and analysts stated that it was unlikely that individuals on the ground carried out the attack, instead suggesting surface-to-surface missiles utilized by Ukraine caused the explosions. According to former squadron leader of SEAL Team Six Chuck Pfarrer, "The craters visible in satellite photos are 10 meters across, ... And each is consistent with the explosion of at least 500 pounds of C4. No Special Forces team is going to drag a ton of C4 to a target when two ounces would be sufficient to destroy an aircraft". On 7 September 2022, Ukrainian commander-in-chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi claimed that a Ukrainian missile attack had been responsible.

## Outcomes
 * 4 Su-24
 * 3 Su-30SM
 * 2 Su-24 damaged
 * 1 Su-30SM damaged
 * 4 Su-24
 * 3 Su-30SM
 * 1 Su-30SM damaged
 * 3 Su-24s damaged
On 10 August, the occupying authorities in Crimea announced that the number of people injured had increased to 13, and one person had died. On 12 August 2022, Anton Herashchenko, an advisor to Ukraine's Minister of Internal Affairs Denys Monastyrsky, claimed that 60 pilots and technicians had been killed and 100 people wounded in the explosions.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine stated that 9 Russian aircraft were destroyed as a result of the attack on the air base.

On 10 August, satellite images of the consequences of the explosions were published, showing at least 10 Russian aircraft destroyed/damaged on the ground, according to Oryx group researchers:



According to a Ukrainian military site:



Damages of civil infrastructure: 62 high-rise buildings, 20 commercial facilities, and private houses were damaged.

In the wake, many tourists were observed leaving Crimea for Russia, and a Russian state media tourism website boasted of a record set on 15 August for the number of cars crossing the Crimean Bridge.
