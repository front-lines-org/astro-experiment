The **Battle of Pisky** was a series of military engagements for control of the settlements around city of Donetsk (mainly Pisky) between the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation during the Battle for Donbas. The battle was part of a larger Russian objective to encircle Avdiivka.

Ukraine initially denied multiple Russian claims of Pisky's capture, but Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu confirmed Pisky's capture on 2 September 2022.

Russian armed forces launched a major attack on Pervomaiske and neighboring Vodiane on 4 October, from the Pisky direction.

## Background
Pisky was a frontline settlement in Donetsk that is considered a ghost town, having had no significant civilian population since 2014. Located mere yards from separatist territory prior to the battle, Ukraine's 56th Motorized Brigade spent years fortifying the village, with garrison personnel fighting from basements and trenches, and using highway overpasses as staging areas. Pro-Russian separatist forces accused the Ukrainians of using the Pisky stronghold to shell Donetsk city, the capital of the Donetsk People's Republic (DPR).

During the Eastern Ukraine offensive in the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Russian and separatist forces set their sights on seizing the entire Donbas region, consisting of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts. Parts of these oblasts, including their capitals with the same names, were seized in pro-Russian uprisings in 2014. Before Russia officially launched its invasion of Ukraine, Avdiivka was the first place where the conflict escalated, just 3km north of Pisky. On 13 March 2022, Russian forces bombed the Avdiivka coking plant. On 17 March, Russian and separatist forces launched an offensive on Marinka, located a few kilometers south of Pisky. Like Pisky, Marinka is seen as a defensive stronghold of the Ukrainian forces on the dividing line between Ukraine and the Russian-backed separatist states, the DPR and the Luhansk People's Republic (LPR).

On the night of 18 April, Russian forces launched an intensive bombing campaign against Ukrainian positions in Luhansk, Donetsk, and Kharkiv Oblasts, beginning the battle of Donbas. On 13 June, Ukrainian forces launched an artillery attack that reportedly hit a market in Donetsk city, killing five people. The DPR accused Ukraine of carrying out shelling attacks from the areas of Pisky and Krasnogorovka. On the night of 28-29 July, a prison was destroyed in Molodizhne near the village of Olenivka, a settlement southwest of Donetsk in DPR territory. The Russians accused the Ukrainians of having launched an attack with American-supplied HIMARS rocket systems from the area of â€‹â€‹Pisky, Marinka, and Vuhledar, and on the same day it was decided to launch a general offensive in the direction of those three places.

## Battle
On 28 July, DPR and Russian forces launched an offensive to surround Avdiivka. Russian and separatist forces assaulted the towns of Krasnohorivka, Pisky, and other towns north of Avdiivka, with unspecified gains. On 31 July, the Ukrainian General Staff reported that Russian forces attempted advances around Kamianka and Pisky and that unspecified separate Russian units had "partial success" around Avdiivka. The DPR's Deputy Information Minister Daniil Bezsonov claimed that Russian and DPR forces secured positions on the southeastern outskirts of Pisky, which was consistent with Ukrainian reports. The Head of the Avdiivka City Military Administration, Vitalii Barabash, said that only 10 percent of the pre-war population of Avdiivka remained, or about 2,500 people.

Ukraine said on 5 August that it lost the Butivka coal mine to Russia and claimed it was pushed to the outskirts of Avdiivka. The DPR claimed its forces and Russia took Pisky on this day, a claim Ukraine rejected. On 7 August, the Russian defence ministry said its forces were storming the village and clearing it of "nationalists." Combat footage showed that Russian troops had reached the centre of Pisky. By 12 August, Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reported that, based on combat footage and satellite imagery, much of Pisky had been leveled by Russian artillery during the battle, which reportedly included TOS-1A thermobaric artillery systems.

Russian and pro-Russian forces reportedly used the attritional tactic of battering Ukrainian defenses with heavy artillery bombardment which was followed up with infantry assaults, making the defense of the fortified settlement "costly," as the defenders reportedly lacked counter-battery fire capabilities. One soldier from Ukraine's 56th Motorized Brigade wrote, "The battalion simply holds back the onslaught with their bodies," adding that "without a counter-battery fight, it turns into a senseless meat grinder, where an insane amount of our infantry is ground up in a day." Ukrainian commander Volodymyr Rehesha, who took part in the battle, later claimed on 28 August that Ukraine suffered a total of 500 combat fatalities in the fighting for Pisky.

### Fall of Pisky
On 13 August, the Russian defence ministry and separatist authorities again claimed to have fully captured Pisky, however, Ukraine's Eastern Command denied the Russian claim and said clashes for control of the village were ongoing. The ISW assessed that Russian and DPR forces may not have fully captured and cleared Pisky by this date, but they had begun consolidating positions in the area to launch further attacks on surrounding settlements such as Pervomaiske, Nevelske, and Optyne.

On 21 August, Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov claimed that Russian forces had consolidated control of Pisky and that demining operations were underway. Geolocated footage posted online on 24 August showed DPR troops troops hoisting a Soviet Victory Banner near the center of Pisky, seemingly unconcerned about Ukrainian artillery fire. The ISW interpreted this as indicating that DPR troops had gained full control of Pisky by this date. However, Avdiivka City Military Administration head Vitaliy Barabash insisted the Russians only controlled half of Pisky as of 29 August. Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu reportedly confirmed the capture of Pisky on 2 September.

## Aftermath
On 31 August, the ISW reported that the DPR's 11th Regiment were fighting in the Pisky-Pervomaiske area, "likely seeking to push the frontline further west of Donetsk City." Russian shelling of Avdiivka continued. After securing Pisky, the Russians began advancing westward towards Pervomaiske, with the Russians capturing a hilly area in the Pisky area and the 11th Regiment capturing a bridge on the approach to the town, according to Russian sources.
